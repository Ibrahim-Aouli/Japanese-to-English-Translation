Summoner!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Are you Summoner-sama?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Yes.
I'm called {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hikuri.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Hello, Hikuri.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Hikuri.
{Yuna}-sama, Nagisetsu.
Will you make it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Okay!
Please look forward to it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Hikuri.
Yay!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Looking forward to {Yuna}-sama's Nagisetsu.
I will respectfully wait.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Yes, I will do my best.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Guard's Shop, thank you for your hard work as well.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
What is Nagisetsu?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Nagisetsu is when '{Sin}'
is not present.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
After the Summoner defeats '{Sin}',
until the next '{Sin}' appears.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
{Sin}... is reborn.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Oh, I see!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
I was thinking it was strange.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
{Yuna}'s father 10 years ago...
He defeated {Sin}, didn't he?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Yet {Sin} is still here...
What's the meaning of that? I thought.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
But... {Sin}...
Knowing it's reborn...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Even so, defeating {Sin} is meaningless...
...Don't say something like that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

No matter how painful...
--------------------------------------------------End--

without fearing {Sin}...
days we can sleep peacefully...
--------------------------------------------------End--

cannot be replaced by anything...
creating precious time...
--------------------------------------------------End--

to call that meaningless...
...Don't say that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

At that time, {Yuna}'s 言42+53.
I remember it well.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's dangerous with so many monsters.
Here, take this.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's armor that defends against monster flames.
Summoner, please use it!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm watching {Crusader} pass by.
So cool...
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I grow up, should I join {Crusader}?
Or become a Blitz player... I can't decide.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My sister is waiting, but...
I'll just watch a little longer.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What are you doing!?
Don't [42+54] my ball without permission!
--------------------------------------------------End--

But it flew incredibly!
Big brother, you're good!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Big brother, aim for Blitz...
How about joining the Goers?
--------------------------------------------------End--

What's going on?!
I'm in a hurry!
--------------------------------------------------End--

If I were to [42+55] the plan...
That would be a lifelong disgrace!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I have to go.
We can't defeat "{Sin}"... *cough* *cough*
--------------------------------------------------End--

Pant, pant...
I'll collapse before "{Sin}" does.
--------------------------------------------------End--

42+56.42+57.Hit! 42+56.42+57.Hit!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Normally, we'd be riding chocobos.
We were scheduled to patrol, but...
{NEWPAGE}

{Crusader}'s war 42+58.funds are meager,
and the number of chocobos is insufficient.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Normally, the temple provides the funds, but
for this operation alone, that's not the case.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, if we defeat "{Sin}",
the temple will surely acknowledge us.
--------------------------------------------------End--

At the end of the main road, toward "{Crusader}",
they are soliciting 42+59.donations. We ask for your cooperation!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Monk soldiers are so stiff,
and it's hard to talk to them.
{NEWPAGE}

They protect the main road,
and I'm grateful, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--

To the old monk soldier...
...I got scolded.
{NEWPAGE}

...because monsters have appeared and it's dangerous.
You can't 42+60. here.
--------------------------------------------------End--

During the operation, loud noises...
...could be heard a lot.
{NEWPAGE}

I wonder if those were machine sounds?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even though monsters appear here too,
many people are leisurely strolling about, you know.
{NEWPAGE}

They should consider us who 42+56.pare.
(Combined with 7)
--------------------------------------------------End--

You all too, if you have no business, don't leave the town.
Please don't increase our 42+61.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I ran away from {Bevelle}.
I became utterly fed up with that town, you see.
{NEWPAGE}

The Chief Priest is disgracefully 42+62.ing right and 42+62.ing left, and...
The Monk Soldiers are excessively lording it over others, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Since we common folk are watching,
I want the temple to be proper.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm not 42+60.ing or anything.
I'm practicing with my big brother.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If I don't train properly,
when the time comes, I'll 42+63., won't I?
--------------------------------------------------End--

If monsters appear, like big brother...
...I'm practicing so I can escape right away.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I came to {42+60}.bi at my little sister's request, but...
This place is full of monsters, huh...
--------------------------------------------------End--

If I were alone, I could escape, but...
With my little sister along, that won't work.
{NEWPAGE}

And I can't leave her behind.
I'll pray that monsters don't appear.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If monsters disappear from {Spira}...
...I wouldn't have to worry like this.
--------------------------------------------------End--

In the past, like {42+64}.bi, with Grandpa...
...I used to walk around here.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I, by the grace of {Yevon2}...
...am still hale and hearty, but Grandpa...
{NEWPAGE}

...does he have too much energy?
He went off to see『{Sin}』!
--------------------------------------------------End--

As for Grandpa, the scales of『{Sin}』...
...he said he'd bring back as a souvenir.
{NEWPAGE}

When will he act like a {42+59}.ri...
...and settle down, I wonder...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even though big brother and I were playing together...
When a monster appeared, he ran away by himself.
--------------------------------------------------End--

He ran really fast.
That's my big brother for you!
--------------------------------------------------End--

So I won't lose to big brother,
I'll practice running a lot.
--------------------------------------------------End--

From now on, I'll protect {Spira}.
{NEWPAGE}

I lost to 『{Sin} 』last time, but...
I'm fine!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, do you know 『{Sin} 』's weakness?
If you tell me, I'll defeat it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When you're attacked by a monster,
you can rely on us.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
I pray for your safe journey.
--------------------------------------------------End--
