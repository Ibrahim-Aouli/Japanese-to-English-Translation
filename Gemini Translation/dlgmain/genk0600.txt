Aww, are you already leaving?
Please come again.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because few people can ride a Shiparph.
You'll have to wait quite a while to ride.
{NEWPAGE}

But if it's Summoner-sama and your party, you can ride at the very front of the line.
I want you to go to {Zanarkand} soon.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Be careful when shopping around here.
Rip-off shopkeepers are swarming everywhere.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Having caught wind of Master-sama's marriage talks,
the shopkeepers are getting enthusiastic.
{NEWPAGE}

Taking advantage of the celebratory mood,
they're aiming to sell shabby goods.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Until just recently, the shopkeepers...
...were selling goods with {Crusader} in mind.
{NEWPAGE}

What was {Operation Mi'ihen} 42+53.援42+54.42+55. saying to sell things at such high prices?
Rebels and __P0__ are running rampant, and the number of travelers has decreased.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people selling things around here seem to be having a hard time with so few customers.
They say '__P1__' fell in __P0__. It's better not to go north.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It seems __P0__ is holed up in __P1__ and doesn't go outside.
I was planning to return to __P0__ right after __P0__'s tournament ended, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Bevelle} was blockading the road, so I couldn't return home for a long time.
My plans are completely messed up. Please be understanding~
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Guado2} is going around spreading news of the marriage, even though no one asked.
Well, it can't be helped. It's rare good news.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Luca} の大会が終わったら
すぐ{Bevelle} へ婦るつもりだったのに……
{NEWPAGE}

{Crusader} が街道を封42+56.してたから
ずっと婦れなかったのよ
--------------------------------------------------End--

すっかり予定が42+57.っちゃった
かんべんしてほしいわ〜
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Guado2} ったら 聞かれもしないのに
ご結度の話を ふれまわってるわ
{NEWPAGE}

まあ仕方ないわね
めったにない明るいニュースだし
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'll quit {Crusader} too.
I wonder if I should settle down at 42+58.舎.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear {Yuna}-sama is getting married, huh?
That's happy news, isn't it?
{NEWPAGE}

If only {Crusader} had been able to defeat '{Sin}'.
It would have been perfect, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--

By the time we return to 42+58.舎.
It'll probably be right in the middle of the marriage celebration.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Welcome!
Customer, you have a good eye.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you buy from us...
No problems at all, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Welcooome!
Young man, you're lucky.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Right now, we're having a massive sale.
I'll give you a lot of service~
--------------------------------------------------End--
Shipahfu user.
No, no way~
It might seem impossible, you know~?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
I want to somehow request that!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Shipahfu user.
What's no good is no good, you know~
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
What's wrong?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
That guy says this child...
...won't let ride on the Shipāfu!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
It is big, isn't it......
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
Honestly, that guy is infuriating!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
No matter how I think about it...
...I think it's impossible, though......
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
Then, what?
Are you saying we should leave this child behind?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
No, I didn't mean that......
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
It can't be helped.
We'll give up on the Shipāfu.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
Somewhere we can cross on foot...
...we'll search for a path.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
Understood, Captain!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
Isn't that a really big detour!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
If there's no path, we can cut one open.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
That's so reckless......
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
Just like you, {Lucil} Captain!
--------------------------------------------------End--

If there's no path, we can cut one open.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's a word that lingers a bit in my memory.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Lucil} Captain, I wonder if you're doing well.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Once you're ready,
Go talk to the Shipahfu handler.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Riding Shipahfu...
Is it that fun?

{Wakka} 
You don't get it at all...

Huge animals. That is boys' eternal...
Longing!

{Wakka} ＆{Tidus} 
Right!

When you shop around here,
Be sure to choose `42+67.`.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
How dull.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Regarding Shipahfu's biology,
There are many things I don't understand.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
For example... yes, food.
Shipahfu eats nothing.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Just by sucking in river water with `42+69.`,
it maintains that huge body.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Tiny, tiny creatures in the water.
There is also the idea of not eating.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
That's about it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
The Shipaafu wielders...
The waterside people, the 'Hypero Tribe'.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Even if they're loafing around on land...
In the water, they are incredibly swift.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
They seem like they could become good Blitz players, though...
(Combined with line 7)
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
They are a carefree bunch, after all.
They don't feel inclined at all.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
That's about it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
For now, I have had my say.
