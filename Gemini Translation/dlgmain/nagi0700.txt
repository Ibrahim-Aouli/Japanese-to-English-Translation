You defeated him!?
Oh... what strength!
{NEWPAGE}

Very well! From now on, you
shall bear the title of "The One Who Surpasses All"!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even the strongest monster I created
you've defeated, after all.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Indeed! It's nothing short of splendid!
I can't find any other words.
{NEWPAGE}

All that's left is to defeat "Shin"!
I'm looking forward to it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

No new monsters will appear anymore, but...
you can battle anytime, though.
{NEWPAGE}

If you want to fight, anytime
come here.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Of course, you'll have to pay the fee!
Hoh ho ho...
--------------------------------------------------End--

This is where the hero of old, Lord {Mi'ihen}
established this training ground for {Crusader}.
{NEWPAGE}

By battling monsters gathered from all over {Spira}
you can hone your skills!
--------------------------------------------------End--

But... because I made a mistake,
all the monsters ran away.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I no longer have the power to gather monsters.
My powers are completely depleted...
--------------------------------------------------End--

So, young man! As a favor, in my place,
won't you gather the monsters for me?
{NEWPAGE}

Of course, I wouldn't ask you to do it for free.
If you gather the monsters, I'll be very generous with the reward!
{NEWPAGE}

Furthermore! With the monsters you gather, you can
battle anytime! In other words, it's practical training!
--------------------------------------------------End--

And what's more! Any items obtained from monsters during training,
all those items are yours!
{NEWPAGE}

However! The training {42+53} fee will be as usual,
{42+54} I will receive it, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--

How about that! Isn't it a good offer?
If you accept, you won't lose out, hmm?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hmm... with the many items I possess,
I was thinking of giving you a reward...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I thought you'd say that! Well then, right away,
go and capture those monsters!
--------------------------------------------------End--

...I want to say that, but first, a warning!
--------------------------------------------------End--

To capture monsters, not ordinary weapons,
{Yellow} you must use special weapons to deliver the finishing blow{White}!
{NEWPAGE}

Oh, rest assured! That weapon is
I will sell it to you for a bargain 42+55.42+56.!
--------------------------------------------------End--

And another thing! At my place, I can keep
monsters, up to 10 per type!
{NEWPAGE}

Even if you gather more than that, nothing at all
will come of it, so take heed!
--------------------------------------------------End--

This is a training ground where you can battle monsters, but
because the monsters escaped, it is now 42+57.empty.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Therefore, on my behalf, {Spira} from within
I need you to gather monsters.
{NEWPAGE}

If you bring monsters, I'll be generous with the reward.
Rare items too, I'll be generous with!
{NEWPAGE}

Furthermore, you can battle the gathered monsters and train as well.
Items obtained during training are also yours.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, the training 42+53.fee is as usual.
{42+54} I will receive it, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--

How about that? Isn't it a good deal?
Won't you accept?
--------------------------------------------------End--

How about it? In my stead,
could you gather monsters for me?
--------------------------------------------------End--

For now, I want you to gather
all types of monsters from __P0__.
{NEWPAGE}

If the monster types aren't complete,
I can't reopen the training ground.
--------------------------------------------------End--

By the way, there are a total of {Yellow} 9 types{White} of monsters in {Calm Lands}.
If you gather them all, I'll give you something good.
{NEWPAGE}

Oh, for catching monsters,
you mustn't forget a special weapon!
{NEWPAGE}

I'll specially sell it to you {42+55.42+56.}.
Be grateful!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The monsters of {Calm Lands} you've gathered so far are {VAR12:30} types, aren't they?
Only {VAR12:31} types remain.
{NEWPAGE}

Weak monsters are all over the place, but for big ones,
if you're aiming for them, search around the northern plains!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh! Now the monsters of {Calm Lands} are all gathered!
Hmm! I can finally reopen the training ground!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh, I almost forgot.
This is a token of my gratitude.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, can you open it?
I don't know, though.
