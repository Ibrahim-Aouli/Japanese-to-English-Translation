These passages are a little creaky, but...
Don't worry about it! As long as you can walk, it's fine.

『{Sin} 』 hasn't been seen lately, it seems.
Maybe it's gathering its strength before a rampage.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Nagi sequence still hasn't come, has it?
What are those flying ship folks doing?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The repairs for the city damaged by 『{Sin} 』...
They're mostly finished.
{NEWPAGE}

The expressions on the city's people also...
...have brightened up, but...
{NEWPAGE}

When everyone looks at the sea...
...they have a frightened look in their eyes.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if the city rebuilds, everyone's...
...wounds of the heart haven't disappeared.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Broken things can be fixed, but...
...the dead don't come back...

I pray without missing a single day.
--------------------------------------------------End--

--------------------------------------------------End--

Hmm...
What was I supposed to do?
--------------------------------------------------End--
