{Gatta} 
Hey, you were taken by {{Sin}}, right?
Was that recently?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Probably...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Then, near the island...
Is {{Sin}} there?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
You're not hiding anything, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Of course!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
If {{Sin}} came near here,
it should come to capture the island.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
However... there is no such sign.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
I don't know, but I...
I don't know anything.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Anyway, this {{Crusader}} thing, I...
I don't really understand it well.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
That's about it, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
{{Sin}}'s venom, huh...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
{{Gatta}}, explain it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Yes, I will go first!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
{{Crusader}} is an entity born to fight {{Sin}}.
生まれた組応である
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Within {Spira}, there are 42+53. sections, and there...
...anyone who wishes can participate in them.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
{Crusader} has its origins in '42+55.Zan42+56.',
created 800 years ago by the hero, Lord __P1__.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Later on, it expanded the organization and changed its name to {Crusader}.
Ever since, {Sin} has continued to fight against '{Sin}'.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Continuing to fight for 800 years...
You can't defeat '{Sin} ' ?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Ah...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
What {Crusader} can do is...
...make '{Sin} ' change its course, or...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
Well, frankly speaking, that's about the extent of it.
Probably, we cannot defeat '{Sin}'.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
{Crusader}'s main duty, which originates from Lord {Sin}, is to protect...
...temples, towns, villages, and people.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Then who will defeat '{Sin} ' ?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
...The poisonous influence of '{Sin} '...
Is it really this terrible?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
No, this is quite terrible.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
It's simple to tell you, but...
If possible, it's better if you remember it yourself.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
Go to the temple and offer a prayer.
"May you remember everything," and such.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Soon, with {Crusader}'s power,
We might be able to defeat 『{Sin} 』.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
An incredible plan has been devised.
It's a plan that will go down in {Crusader}'s history.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
We, from the temple...
...have been excommunicated.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
We have to leave here now too.
That means we have no choice but to dedicate everything to the plan.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
We'll head to the beach while defeating monsters.
Once we arrive, immediately to a state of alert!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
If 『{Sin} 』 appears,
Contact immediately, understood!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Alright, everyone, depart!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Hey!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Hi!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Not "Hi!"
What happened?!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
It's training. Training.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
When {Sin} will come.
And we never know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
If we don't train properly.
We won't be able to protect the village in an emergency, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Honestly... I'm `心42+70.` but...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
In front of Koukyo, complaints like that...
I can't say.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Maybe {Luzzu} was like that too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Even if things were tough.
Couldn't say them in front of you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
So, without showing weakness.
Was doing their best, or something like that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Perhaps...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Then, I'll be going soon.
And I can't leave them alone.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Do your best.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
You too!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
The operation failed, but even so...
There are people who will join {Crusader}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
What {P0} our predecessor did was...
...not in vain, was it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Even if excommunicated by the temple, to protect {P0},
{P0} is necessary.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Say, the rumor that the temple is in chaos...
...is it true?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
After excommunicating us,
what are they doing!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
The temple is unreliable, and...
...{P0} has no choice but to do its best, I guess.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
The '{P0}' that was cornered and weakened...
...fell into {P0}, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
{P0}'s {P1} predecessor also...
...must surely be pleased.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Until '{P0}' is gone,
it's just one more step, right!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard you came from the sea.
I heard it from {Luzzu} and them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

By Lord {High Summoner Gandof}'s power.
Please protect my family...
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's the preparations before going out to 42+71.
Monsters also appear in the sea, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Don't say foolish things.
Do you intend to break 42+72, you brat {E}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Together with Dad.
Pray for your 42+73. Understood?
--------------------------------------------------End--

You too, for {Juushou}-sama's 42+73.
(See line 15)
--------------------------------------------------End--

It might be better if your malice doesn't disappear.
(See line 17)
{NEWPAGE}

Painful things and sad things too.
You can remain having forgotten them, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple has its back to the sea.
Shall I teach you the truth?
{NEWPAGE}

From the sea, 『{Sin} 』 comes.
I want to look away.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'll be leaving on a journey soon, to '{Sin}'.
I'm praying not to meet them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's the preparations before going out to 42+71.
Monsters also appear in the sea, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This year's {Aurochs} was an intense struggle.
{Wakka} did well.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I cannot be of help to Lord {Yuna},
Let me pray for your safe journey.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if I know that 『{Sin} 』 is in the sea.
If I don't travel, I can't make a living.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're rebels, I hear?
Oh dear, what a terrible false accusation.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Yuna}-sama's Nagi42+76...
...who knows when it will be.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple is only chasing rebels, and
『{Sin} 』 is neglected.
{NEWPAGE}

The day I can travel without worry...
seems still far off.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Nagi42+76 will be leaving on a journey soon.
It seems we'll meet on the ship.
--------------------------------------------------End--

While I was on my journey, a flying ship and...
{Sin} flew past.
{NEWPAGE}

I was looking up, forgetting even to sing.
It was an astonishing sight.
--------------------------------------------------End--

On the flying ship, {Yevon2}'s gift...
I am praying you will be protected.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Rare appearance, isn't it? Where are you from?
It's your first time coming to {Besaid}, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because outsiders don't come very often.
I remember all the faces of those who came.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone went to the temple, but...
I'll decide to pray at home.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just thinking about if something were to happen...
Even going to check on things is scary...
--------------------------------------------------End--

With this, {Yuna}-sama is also a full-fledged...
Summoner-sama, aren't they?
{NEWPAGE}

When you came to {Besaid}...
You were so small...
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Yuna} should be able to become the Great Summoner.
Everyone connected to {Besaid} believes that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It seems {Crusader}'s plan failed.
Will {Luzzu} and the others return having resisted?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I have no intention of defying the teachings, but...
Lately, there's something strange about the temple.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Dad, not at all...
He doesn't play with me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To join the Extermination Squad, or {Aurochs}...
I'm having trouble deciding.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm good at Blitz!
I can even hold my breath for a long time!
--------------------------------------------------End--

To join the Extermination Squad,
I hear you have to train.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The three of us: {Luzzu}, {Gatta}, and me,
will defeat '{Sin}!'
--------------------------------------------------End--

Dad, what should we do?
Let's go help!
--------------------------------------------------End--

But...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yeah!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'll be a good boy, so...
Help Jushō-sama...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Summoner came to the village the other day.
Umm... what was their name again?
--------------------------------------------------End--

My brother's malice.
It seems to have been cured.
--------------------------------------------------End--

P0 and the others haven't returned.
What could have happened to them?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Is it true that P0-sama is a rebel?
Everyone is saying it's a lie.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Letters arrived from everyone in P0.
They're working hard in P0, they say.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Really, will 'P0' very soon...
...disappear, I wonder?
--------------------------------------------------End--

While I am healthy, {Besaid}'s offering...
I will not allow the tradition to be changed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's nothing to worry about. If it's that person, surely...
...they will surely return.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just because it took a little time...
...panicking would be disrespectful.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if 'P0' comes tomorrow.
Our current way of life will not change.
{NEWPAGE}

I will just continue my work in silence.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't care who the rebel is.
If we defeat '{Sin}', everything will be canceled.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Until Nagi42+76 truly arrives, I cannot feel at ease.
I don't want to celebrate prematurely.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Watched over by Lord {Braska}.
Jūshō-sama is probably giving it their all too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's hot, so go into the shade.
You'll collapse.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Last month, I responded to many, but...
The whole ship was taken out by 『{Sin} 』...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The one who came from the sea...
Is that you?
{NEWPAGE}

You still have some venom in you, don't you?
You should rest properly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Not returning even for a single night...
I'm terribly worried.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Regarding that person, for anything strange to happen...
I don't think will happen, though...
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's good that the ferry has started moving, but...
I wonder if '{Sin}' won't appear again...
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Crusader} who fought '{Sin},'
apparently had a terrible experience.
{NEWPAGE}

Truly, what a cruel story...
It's because they break the teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When {Crusader}'s children return,
we'll have to scold them thoroughly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The other day, many monk soldiers
came to search for Lord {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If Lord {Yuna} defeats '{Sin},'
the unpleasant rumors should disappear too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

On that flying ship,
I wonder who was on board...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thanks to the flying ship,
the whole village is bustling.
{NEWPAGE}

Everywhere in {Spira}
it might be the same.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Welcome!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
Buy {CHOICE:30} items.
{CHOICE:31} I'll pass.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30} Buy weapons.
{CHOICE:31} Buy items.
{CHOICE:32} I'll pass.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thank you very much.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, Jushou-sama...
Has everyone from __P0__ still not returned?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Accompanying {Yuna}-sama means...
Will you also become a guard?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30} I won't.
{CHOICE:31} Maybe so.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Then you'll focus on the tournament!
Please let {Aurochs} win this year.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There are things I don't understand about the guarding method.
you should ask {Lulu}.
{NEWPAGE}

{Lulu} is strong and very knowledgeable.
{Wakka} is much more reliable than {Wakka}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hope the poison heals soon.
{NEWPAGE}

While praying for {Yuna}-sama's safety...
I'll also pray for you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There are rumors about you.
It's a small village, so news spreads quickly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This year's tournament, too, {Aurochs}...
Will it be a first-round defeat again...?
{NEWPAGE}

At least to a draw...
I hope they can manage that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It'll be alright, I'm sure.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Don't say such things anymore.
...Please.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Jūshō-sama hasn't returned.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30} Jūshō-sama?
{CHOICE:31} "Hasn't returned," you say?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Jūshō-sama is Jūshō-sama.
I mean Jūshō the Summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They haven't returned from the Hall of Trials.
A whole day has passed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please be safe...
--------------------------------------------------End--

While Big Sister is praying...
That means I'm number one.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Buy again, okay?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Buy again, okay?
{NEWPAGE}

Ah, that's right!
{NEWPAGE}

Today, my child picked something up and brought it back.
What was that, I wonder...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

For {Wakka} to retire...
I think it's a waste.
{NEWPAGE}

With {Wakka} and you, {Aurochs}'s...
I wanted you to build a golden age.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Finally, because the ferry has resumed operation...
I wonder if customers will increase.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks came to look for {Yuna}.
They said, 'Those who harbor him are also rebels!'
{NEWPAGE}

I can't believe that sort of important people are protecting the temple.
(Combined with 12)
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Aurochs}'s people are still {Luca}, right?
Let them speak once in a while.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What happened to the airship battle in the end?
Could it be they were defeated...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

This is just between us, but in the current temple...
I heard there isn't even one master monk.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh, that's right, I'll give you this.
This one brought it in its mouth.
{NEWPAGE}

I don't know what it is, somehow.
Well, just keep it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Big brother, who are you?
Where did you come from?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Juushou-sama is missing.
But they haven't come back...
--------------------------------------------------End--

When {Yuna}-sama comes back,
I want to hear many stories.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Summoner-sama came on a ship.
He was a kind older brother.
{NEWPAGE}

But I like {Yuna}-sama more~!
--------------------------------------------------End--

When it becomes calm, with {Yuna}-sama...
let's celebrate, okay?
--------------------------------------------------End--

What is a Hangyakusha? Even if I ask Soukan-sama,
they won't tell me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When a ship flies here again,
I must sing with a loud voice!
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's holding something in its mouth...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{Yellow} obtained a sticky, drool-covered {White}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even at night, monsters are lurking around.
You shouldn't go out alone.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even though they know it's dangerous.
There's no way I can let them through.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hope Jūshō-sama is safe...
--------------------------------------------------End--

You shouldn't just wander around either.
I must pray for that person's safety.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Luzzu} and the others have departed for the mission.
I am the caretaker.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Actually, {Gatta} was supposed to be the caretaker, but...
That person insisted on going with them.
{NEWPAGE}

He's reckless, despite being a newcomer.
Even though it's a mission they might die on...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh, would you like to rest?
That's right, you shouldn't overdo it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30} Take a break.
{CHOICE:31} Maybe next time.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Compared to the monsters we fought in the mission...
{Besaid}'s monsters are practically cute.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even I gained 42+97.42+98.
I'll just defeat the monsters.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder if that flying ship is {Al Bhed}'s machine.
This 42+58. time, I really want you to do well.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Subjugation Squad Lodging is open to all travelers.
Will you rest?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I want to go check on the temple, but...
I also have preparations for the operation...
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Wakka} and the others are waiting outside.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Actually, I was also affected by {Sin}'s toxic influence...
...I was one of those affected.
{NEWPAGE}

I'm much better now, though.
At first, it was terrible.
{NEWPAGE}

Even who I was or where I was from...
...I couldn't remember at all.
{NEWPAGE}

At that time, I felt like crying.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thanks to desperately praying at the temple,
my condition improved greatly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you pray at the temple, even a toxic influence like that will be cured.
I'm telling you, there's no 42+99.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please cure my toxic influence quickly...
Soon, it will be a big 42+73. operation...
--------------------------------------------------End--

If it's {Wakka}, they'll be 42+100. found out by the Senior Priest.
went to the temple.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I still have some of '{Sin}'s influence...
Since you haven't fully recovered, you're the 42+95. guard.
{NEWPAGE}

It's frustrating to be left out like this, but
I'm a little relieved.
{NEWPAGE}

This 42+58. operation is dangerous, you know...
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you pray at the temple, even a toxic influence like that will be cured.
I'm telling you, there's no 42+99.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm praying for the 42+73. safety of {Luzzu} and the others.
It's a dangerous operation, after all.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Crusader} was excommunicated, so truthfully,
they shouldn't really enter the temple, but...
{NEWPAGE}

The Monk Official specially permitted it.
They're not just a strict person.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Only empty beds, with no 42+101. in them.
It's gotten quite lonely...
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Operation Mi'ihen}... it didn't work out.
I thought we would surely win!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone, please...
Come back safe and sound...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Prayer cannot defeat monsters.
It's {Crusader} who protects {Besaid}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The poison has finally subsided. Until now...
I need to 42+102. properly for the rest I took.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The battle with '{Sin}' is still ongoing, right?
Can't we do something as well...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm repairing the rain leak.
Don't bother me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's good to be able to 42+103. for free, but...
It's falling apart everywhere, isn't it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Besaid} Village is also 42+58.
It is linked to '{Sin}'.
{NEWPAGE}

This house, too, seems to have been left neglected since it was hit at that time.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We'll be defeated by '{Sin}' eventually anyway.
There are times when 42+102.ing feels foolish.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They don't look robust, and besides...
Their body might not hold up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

By the time {Crusader}'s group returns...
I guess I'll get this rain leak fixed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Crusader} is eager, but those guys...
I don't think we can do anything about 『{Sin}』.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Luzzu} and {Gatta} haven't returned.
Were they defeated on the mission...?
{NEWPAGE}

Or are they ashamed of losing,
Perhaps they are unable to return.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because {Crusader} isn't here,
I feel like the monsters have increased.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't fight monsters, but I have a big 42+104. 42+73. task.
That means I'll 42+105. support {Crusader}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I won't say {Luzzu}'s 42+106. aloud, but...
They're quite depressed.
{NEWPAGE}

The 42+107.42+108. who let {Gatta} die.
They're probably keenly feeling it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Around the time {Gatta} returned from the mission,
they were terribly depressed.
{NEWPAGE}

After they started leading {Crusader},
they finally cheered up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Overcome by the poisonous energy, everything
it seems they've forgotten.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well now, I'll tell you then.
What do you want to hear?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30} "Shin"?
{CHOICE:31} The poisonous air?
{CHOICE:32} Ebon?
{CHOICE:33} Zanarkand?
{CHOICE:34} I won't ask.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30} "Shin"?
{CHOICE:31} The poisonous air?
{CHOICE:32} Ebon?
{CHOICE:33} Zanarkand?
{CHOICE:34} The Great Summoner?
{CHOICE:35} I won't ask.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you listen to my story, you might also...
...recall your own self.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Are there other things you want to hear?
...perhaps?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Good heavens! To think...
...you've even forgotten '{Sin}'?!
{NEWPAGE}

Even if they wish to forget, many people have unforgettable feelings...
...and yet...
{NEWPAGE}

{Sin} appeared 1000 years ago and...
It's a monster 42+109. ravaging this land of {Spira}.
{NEWPAGE}

All the people born in {Spira}...
...are suffering from {Sin}.
{NEWPAGE}

To think you'd even forget {Sin}...
Well, perhaps that way you'd be happier.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Sin} appeared 1000 years ago and...

{NEWPAGE}

To think you'd even forget {Sin}...
Well, perhaps that way you'd be happier.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Wafting out from {Sin}'s body...
...is tainted air.
{NEWPAGE}

If you breathe that in, the contents of your head...
...get all muddled up.
{NEWPAGE}

That's why anyone who gets close to {Sin}...
I completely forget important things.
{NEWPAGE}

Just like you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To forget {Yevon2}'s teachings...
How deplorable...
{NEWPAGE}

To help the people suffering from '{Sin}'.
It is a great teaching.
{NEWPAGE}

Before you were overcome by the poison...
You should have been living according to the teaching.
{NEWPAGE}

Offer diligent prayers at the temple.
You should remember the teaching.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Long, long ago, it flourished in the far north.
It's the capital.
{NEWPAGE}

However, 1000 years ago,
It was destroyed by '{Sin}'.
{NEWPAGE}

I was becoming useless relying on machines.
They must have received divine retribution.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Those who once fought against '{Sin}'.
I'm referring to the four Summoners.
{NEWPAGE}

{Ohalland}, {Gandof}, {Yocun}.
And {Braska}.
{NEWPAGE}

That this {Spira} was not destroyed by '{Sin}'
is thanks to the Great Summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Now, I am looking after you.
I can't look after it, but don't take it as a favor.
{NEWPAGE}

Because the Junior Summoner-sama hasn't returned from the trial.
The villagers are very anxious.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm so worried, so very worried...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Before departing, knowing many things...
(No separate line, combined with 5)
--------------------------------------------------End--

They say {Aurochs} won for the first time in 23 years,
There are people who scheme, but...
{NEWPAGE}

That {Aurochs} couldn't possibly win.
I won't be fooled!
--------------------------------------------------End--

It seems your malice has completely left you.
It is a blessing from {Yevon2}, how grateful...
--------------------------------------------------End--

We, the people of {Besaid},
all believe in {Yuna}-sama!
{NEWPAGE}

{Braska}-sama's daughter
would not possibly defy the temple.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What the temple's important people are thinking...
the common folk don't understand.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Until I see 『{Sin} 』 fall...
I will live a little longer.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I like Lord Ohaland the most.
Because you resemble the deceased old man.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord {Braska} is with you.
It's sure to return.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What is this disruptor?!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I have nothing to say to a disruptor.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do not disturb my prayer.
You disruptor!
--------------------------------------------------End--

What? You're the guard!?
...Are you still affected by the poisonous air?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Surely not, you wouldn't... Lord {Yuna}...
...trick Lord __P0__, did you?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Until Lord {Yuna}'s naginata comes...
I decided to pray unfailingly every day.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Once the naginata comes, the new Grand Summoner's...
We must install the holy statue.
--------------------------------------------------End--

For someone affected by the poisonous air...
...you seem energetic, you.
{NEWPAGE}

Probably because you didn't inhale much of the poisonous air...
...that's why, isn't it?
{NEWPAGE}

Being a Blitz player means...
You must be good at holding your breath.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I also thought about playing Blitz in the past, but...
I couldn't hold my breath, you see...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Besaid} Object responding at our place is...
...are popular on the continent too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It will only uphold tradition forever.
It won't become an empty shell.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When 42+94. was a child-42+121., the village...
The village was overrun by 『{Sin} 』.
{NEWPAGE}

On that day, when the village became a 42+122. scorched field...
I still dream of it, even now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Something must have happened...
--------------------------------------------------End--

But even the previous Summoner...
...almost their life...
--------------------------------------------------End--

...Sorry.
--------------------------------------------------End--

42+94. and the others could only pray.
42+72., so it can't be helped.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The fact that {Kilika} was overrun...
T- Next, it might be {Besaid}'s turn...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I get distracted because {Sin} is scary, but...
If I mess up, the old man is scary...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The reason {Aurochs} was able to win is because I 42+117. daily...
(No translation for this line, combined with #3)
--------------------------------------------------End--

They say you'll get 42+107.money if you report information about rebels.
They say 42+123. money will be paid.
{NEWPAGE}

People here don't snitch, but...
Be careful in other lands.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder what's happening on the continent?
Not much information comes through.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It seems Lady Yuna's false accusation has been 42+108.
It seems like 42+124. was done.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If only {Sin} would disappear...
Then there would be nothing to say, right...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just when Nagi42+76. is about to arrive.
There's no way I can focus on 42+73. work.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord Jūshō 42+73. for nothing...
(No translation for this line, combined with #17)
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Yevon2}'s teachings are the 42+53. of our hearts.
{NEWPAGE}

If there were no teachings, we would be afraid of {Sin}.
I think I cannot endure this 42+83. life.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's like we were born just to fear 『{Sin}』...
(No separate translation; combined with line 2)
--------------------------------------------------End--

May {Yevon2}'s blessing be upon Jushou-sama...
(No separate translation; combined with line 4)
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please guide {Yuna}-sama's journey...
(No separate translation; combined with line 6)
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I think of {Yuna}-sama's future journey,
No matter how 42+58. I pray, I feel it won't be enough.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If {Lulu} is with us,
it will surely be alright...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because of the machines, many {Crusader} people
died, I heard...
{NEWPAGE}

To make such a precious life into 42+125.42+126.!
unforgivable.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You be careful not to break the teachings.
(No separate translation; combined with line 16)
--------------------------------------------------End--

The 42+127. bond between Lord {Yuna} and {Master Seymor}...
was lost.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Yuna}-sama would never go against the teachings.
Isn't that right?
--------------------------------------------------End--

For the next Nagi42+76. to be as long as possible...
続くことを祈るわ
--------------------------------------------------End--

May Auraka score at least one point...
取れますように……
--------------------------------------------------End--

Since {Wakka} is a Guard too, they should go help.
助けに行けばいいんだよ
--------------------------------------------------End--

For Lord {Yuna}, 42+117. daily.
お祈りするって決めたんだ
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard that Lord {Braska} and two Guards came to the village around the time I was born.
ふたりのガードが 村に来たんだってさ
--------------------------------------------------End--

May Lord {Yuna} quickly defeat '{Sin}' ...
やっつけてくれますように……
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Priest Official told us the story of Lord {Yunalesca} and Lord {Zaon}.
お話を聞かせてくれたよ
{NEWPAGE}

The current {Yunalesca} exists because Lord {Yunalesca} worked hard, doesn't it?
今の{Spira} が あるんだよね
--------------------------------------------------End--

If I were as strong as Lord {Zaon}, I could have become a Guard too...
ぼくもガードになれたのになあ
--------------------------------------------------End--

One who is not a Guard...
Do not approach the Hall of Trials.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you pray devoutly,
Even the poison will likely be cured.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The sacred statues of the Great Summoners are, from the right,
Lord {Braska}, Lord Yonkun...
{NEWPAGE}

Lord Oharando and Lord Gandofu.
Well? Did you recall?
--------------------------------------------------End--

As for 42+72. and furi, let's put it aside for now.
Let us celebrate the 42+128.life of the new summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Come on, quickly to the village square! You too,
Please share the 42+130. and 42+85.joy.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It is also partly due to the poison.
Let's overlook the matter of 42+72.yafuri.
{NEWPAGE}

However, only this time.
From now on, you must follow the teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The youths of {Crusader} are planning a strategy that goes against {Yevon2}'s teachings.
...
{NEWPAGE}

It's regrettable... for lives to be lost by breaking the teachings.
For {Chappu} alone to lose their life is enough.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Your 42+80.complexion has improved since the other day, hasn't it?
Has the toxic effect of 『{Sin} 』 worn off?
--------------------------------------------------End--

A Summoner is currently undertaking a trial.
You must not interfere.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We have not yet informed the islanders, but...
They say {Maester Mika2} has passed away...
{NEWPAGE}

What on earth is happening at {Bevelle}?
(Combined with 6)
--------------------------------------------------End--

If the temple is in chaos,
only anxiety will spread among the people.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A flying ship... could it possibly be {Al Bhed}'s
machine?
{NEWPAGE}

Is it right to provide 42+105.support?
I am somewhat conflicted.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if we investigate {Yevon2}'s 42+97.42+131., it's of 『{Sin}』's
method to relieve the toxic effects of 『__P1__ 』 is not recorded.
{NEWPAGE}

If you have {Yevon2}'s 42+78.fruit...
the toxic effects might be removed...
--------------------------------------------------End--

You... {Yevon2}'s 42+78.fruit...
(Combined with 18)
--------------------------------------------------End--

The most favorable 42+73.situation might occur.
My heart aches as well.
{NEWPAGE}

However, if you do not over42+132.come this trial...
That person will have no future...
--------------------------------------------------End--

To acquire immense power...
It will involve great 42+133.suffering.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When {Crusader} returns...
I will warmly 42+77.provide it.
{NEWPAGE}

Returning 42+134.them to the path of correct teachings is...
...the 42+59.duty of one who serves as a clerical official.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Summoner's journey seems to be going smoothly.
Hmm, very well, very well.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The communication from {St. Bevelle} Palace...
...has been cut off.
{NEWPAGE}

The temples of 42+135.this land are going right 42+136.and left 42+136..
How regrettable...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I could not approach the temple for a while.
That's right.
{NEWPAGE}

Rest assured, no matter what others do...
This temple will 42+137.42+77.you all.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even the teachings of {Yevon2} that have lasted 1000 years...
It seems a great turning point is 42+77.approaching.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If {Sin} perishes, then {Yevon2}'s
Even the teachings might finish their 42+59.role.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people of {Besaid} are very 42+138.truly...
uphold the teachings of {Yevon2}.
{NEWPAGE}

Even I, a monastic official, am taught
many things by the people.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I understand {Crusader}'s feelings well, but...
Going against the teachings is a problem.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Watched over by the sacred statue, Lord Jūshō
must also be full of enthusiasm.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Are you alright regarding {Sin}'s poisonous aura?
Praying at the temple is the quickest way to recover.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Excuse me, but could you please
leave me alone?
{NEWPAGE}

A prayer for that person's 42+73.safety.
しておりますので……
--------------------------------------------------End--

You too, please offer prayers
along with the villagers.
--------------------------------------------------End--

From now on, not Lord Jūshō...
I must apologize to {Yuna}...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, 42+72.yafurisan, from now on...
You must properly observe the teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord/Lady Summoner, in order to help the people,
will embark on an arduous journey.
{NEWPAGE}

We must offer heartfelt prayers.
We must do so.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The poison will surely be cured.
You must not be afraid.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I understand {Crusader}'s feelings, but...
Going against the teachings is a problem.
--------------------------------------------------End--

All of the islanders are praying for Lord/Lady {Yuna}'s
I am praying for your safety.
{NEWPAGE}

Of course, I am the same.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Yuna}'s achievements also extend to this island.
They are being conveyed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear you have become a Guard.
I'm counting on you, Lord/Lady {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The order to capture Lord/Lady {Yuna}...
...has been conveyed even to {Besaid}.
{NEWPAGE}

Both the islanders and the temple officials are bewildered.
That shouldn't be possible...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The monk-soldiers who came to the island were terrible ruffians...
They're no different from thugs.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Now that {Maester Mika2} is gone, the people of {Yevon2}...
Who should they rely on?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I have believed in {Yevon2}'s teachings since childhood.
I have followed them.
{NEWPAGE}

Even if the temple lies in ruins.
I know no other way but to pray.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Besaid} merchandise being produced here...
...is of quite good quality.
{NEWPAGE}

If we buy them cheaply and sell them...
It's definitely going to be profitable.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Look! Even if the whole village is agitated,
...they calmly continue their work.
{NEWPAGE}

That's impressive.
A great person should be like this.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Of course, I'm worried too!
But... the people have no choice but to wait.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That old man abandoned his work and
...went to see the Summoner.
{NEWPAGE}

As a result, his work was pushed onto me.
This is no way to run a shop.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't indulge in idle talk.
If I'm lazy, that dog will be annoying.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if a reinforcement joins, {Aurochs}...
I don't think it will get stronger.
{NEWPAGE}

Anyway, this year we'll be defeated in the first round again. As for the championship...
The championship is decided by our {Luca Goers}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Crusader}'s strategy, regarding {Yevon2}'s teachings...
I hear that __P0__'s strategy goes against __P1__'s teachings.
{NEWPAGE}

They are a pushy group despite being weak.
They should just leave it to the Summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard, at the {Luca} tournament...
You had great success, didn't you?
{NEWPAGE}

Well, thanks to the {Aurochs} effect...
The popularity of {Besaid} merchandise might also increase.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard {Crusader} suffered a crushing defeat.
They are an ungrateful lot.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I was impressed by the old man.
{NEWPAGE}

Even if 『{Sin} 』 comes right in front of you.
I suppose they'll continue the work.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh! Rebels!
What brazen rascals!
--------------------------------------------------End--

...it's tend, they say.
Don't glare at me like that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear the temples on the continent are in chaos, it's terrible.
Honestly, with this, business is completely ruined.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I didn't believe the stories about flying ships.
A ship flying, that's like something out of a dream, isn't it?
{NEWPAGE}

So, when the ship actually flew here...
I almost said 42+148.!
--------------------------------------------------End--

When the ship flew here, the old man also...
They were singing while working!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Searching for a land without 『{Sin} 』.
I've been traveling, but...
{NEWPAGE}

There's no such land anywhere, I see.
It seems better to give up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The village where I was born is no longer there.
It was wiped out by 『{Sin} 』.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because the villagers are worried.
It's better to keep quiet.
{NEWPAGE}

Just because they're affected by the poison...
You must not hurry.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Several villagers to the pier
I went to visit.
{NEWPAGE}

Even if I visit the departing Summoner-sama...
It'll only make things more painful, won't it...
--------------------------------------------------End--

You must be careful not to break the teachings.
Otherwise, you'll be excommunicated like {Crusader}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A Summoner named {Isaaru} came to the village.
But they disappeared quickly...
--------------------------------------------------End--

As expected, {Crusader}'s plan failed.
It's because they rely on machines.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Crusader}, which was destroyed by {Operation Mi'ihen},
I heard they're regaining their strength in 42+135. land.
{NEWPAGE}

On the other hand, the warrior monks' reputation is the worst.
They are holed up in {Bevelle} and aren't coming out, they say.
--------------------------------------------------End--

For the excommunicated {Crusader} to be protecting the people...
It's strange, somehow...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'll also learn {Besaid} oubutsu.
I wonder if I should try working here...
--------------------------------------------------End--

With something like a song, can we really defeat 『{Sin}』?
I'm uneasy, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sailors' work involves a lot of worries.
I have to relax once in a while.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That 『{Sin}』 appeared in the nearby waters...
Is the rumor true?
{NEWPAGE}

This is bad... the Riki-go's departure...
Even though it's soon...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please, please, even on the next voyage...
May we not meet 『{Sin}』...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The attendant summoners heading to the temple on 42+91. day...
I saw them.
{NEWPAGE}

Because they looked well, I thought they would be alright...
Even though I was thinking that... it can't be.
--------------------------------------------------End--

One more time, their energetic form.
once more.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I will, until the next ship comes,
relax in this village.
--------------------------------------------------End--

During the voyage, there's no time to rest.
I'm constantly on edge about 『{Sin} 』.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you dawdle,
the ferry will leave.
{NEWPAGE}

The next ship won't come for a while.
If you miss it, it'll be a big problem.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please, please, even on the next voyage...
May we not meet 『{Sin}』...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Near the island, {Al Bhed2}'s ship...
...someone saw.
{NEWPAGE}

Those guys, for what purpose...
...did they come here, I wonder?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I like this village. Giving up being a sailor...
...and living here might be good.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My friend is on the ferry.
I'll pray for his sake.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Guado2}'s guys apparently blew up {Al Bhed2}'s...
...dwelling.
{NEWPAGE}

No matter how helpful {Al Bhed} is, it's too much.
They did cruel things.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if the temple is in chaos,
this village is quiet.
--------------------------------------------------End--

May the temple's confusion subside.
I wonder if it's strange to pray?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The way the flying ship fought was amazing.
Maybe we should re-evaluate {Al Bhed}'s people.
