Datto.
You finally woke up!?
{Wakka} is waiting!
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Wakka} is waiting!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ah...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wanted to believe it was a good dream.
{NEWPAGE}

That this was a dream, and when I woke up...
Everything would be back to normal... I thought.
{NEWPAGE}

But even when things were lined up, nothing had changed...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Father...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The sea is so beautiful, but...
Somewhere, 'Sin' is lurking.
{NEWPAGE}

Just thinking that gives me chills.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if we repair it like this...
If '{Sin}' comes again, it'll be the end.
{NEWPAGE}

Destroyed and repaired, repaired and...
Destroyed... it's that repetition.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's not just Kilika, all of Spira...
...is plagued by 'Sin' and falling apart.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A Summoner named {Dona} just passed by.
Apparently they're riding the ferry.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{P0} was quite a departed being, but...
It might be a little too harsh...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everything was destroyed.
I have no idea where to even begin repairs.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because of {P0}, all of Kilika...
has lost its spirit.
{NEWPAGE}

If Kilika's team wins this tournament...
I think everyone's spirits will {42+53} too, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thanks to Lady Yuna coming,
Everyone was able to go to the Farplane peacefully.
{NEWPAGE}

That's something to be thankful for.
It's a blessing from Yevon.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My {42+54}s probably went to the Farplane without getting lost...
--------------------------------------------------End--

{P0} is a {42+55} inflicted upon humans.
There's nothing we can do about it.
{NEWPAGE}

We have no choice but to leave it to Yevon's teachings and the Summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--
