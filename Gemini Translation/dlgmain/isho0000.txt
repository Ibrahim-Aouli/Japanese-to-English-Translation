--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I heard from {Kimahri}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
He said to take me from {Bevelle}.
Father's words...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
What was conveyed to {Kimahri} was...
You were the one who conveyed it to {Auron}, weren't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I had wanted to meet you someday,
I was thinking.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I'm happy to meet you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
To have you even serve as my guard...
How should I thank you...?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
No...
Your thanks is to defeat '{Sin}'.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
That's right.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Yes.
I will defeat '{Sin}'.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
By the time everyone sees this...
'{Sin}' will already be gone.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
And... me too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
So I'll say it while I still can.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
{Auron}
Thank you very much.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
{Kimahri} ……
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Do you remember the day we first met?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I was seven years old.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Dad defeated 『{Sin} 』,
It was a big fuss...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Everyone praised Dad...
I was happy as if it were my own.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
But when night came, I thought.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
He defeated 『{Sin} 』, but...
Dad had died.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
That I was all alone.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I couldn't sleep, so I just went out to town,
Passing through the bustling street...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I went to {Bevelle}'s long bridge,
and gazed at it alone.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
From the bridge where I saw Dad off,
the plain where Dad fought.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Then, {Kimahri} appeared.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
He said he was looking for {Braska}'s 42+53..
I told you, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
At first... I was scared.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
But I understood right away.
That he was a kind person.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Talking with child 42+54.
I wasn't used to it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
That I was {Braska}'s 42+53.
If 42+55. ...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
To the place farthest from {Bevelle}.
That they would take me...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
That this was the 42+56. of a dying person.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I cried, didn't I?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
That was, you know, because Father...
Had died...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
That I wouldn't see him anymore...
Because I understood...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
{Kimahri}, without saying anything...
42+57. hugged me...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Even after arriving with {Besaid}...
I cried, didn't I?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
When you entrusted me to the temple...
{Kimahri} tried to leave the village, didn't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
"Don't go!"
I clung to you and cried.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Ever since then, you've always been by my side...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
{Kimahri} ...Truly, thank you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I like your 42+58.reta horns.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
{Wakka} {Lulu}
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
The days spent 42+59.rashita with {Besaid}.
I will never forget them.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
The three of us, with {Chappu}.
You often 42+60.nde with me.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
That's why I...
I was always able to stay energetic.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
When I said I would become a summoner,
even though you opposed it so much...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I'm sorry.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I had thought about apologizing someday.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
But, when I was opposed,
I was very happy.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
You were worried about me,
I thought, 'You're worried about me.'
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Truly, like an older brother and
it was like I had an older sister.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
No.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
As a real older brother and
older sister, I think.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Is it strange?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Plays Blitz.
I like {Wakka}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Angry {Lulu}.
I like you no matter how much I'm scolded.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
It hasn't been long since we met, but...
...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
...It's strange.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Is this what it's like?
I thought.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
It was more than I imagined...
...a very overwhelming feeling...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
It's overwhelming, but...it's painful.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Hmm... I wonder what it is.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Something feels strange...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Reshoot this part.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Umm...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
What are you doing?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
...And then.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
New Guard.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
{Zanarkand Abes}'s ace.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
You...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
You...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Umm...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I'm glad... I met you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I can't put it into words.
Anyway, I'm glad I met you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Is that why it's so painful...?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
The thought of parting with you...
When I think about it...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
...I'm scared.
--------------------------------------------------End--
