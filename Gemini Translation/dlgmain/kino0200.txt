Let's go!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}

Shoot!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{Lucil} 
Charge!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Tch...
It's a guaranteed failure, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Let's stop already.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
It might be a reckless operation.
It might go against the teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
But {Crusader} and {Al Bhed}'s...
...people are... very serious.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Everyone wants to defeat '{Sin}'.
They truly hope for it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Those feelings are, with ours...
...not different at all.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Don't you think so?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Heh, alright.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
But, I won't acknowledge machines.
I won't acknowledge anything that goes against the teachings!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
Summoner, so you were here.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
The command center is over there.
{Maester Kinoc} was also here.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
{Kinoc} as well?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
Yes, {Yuna}, please hurry as well.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
The battle will begin soon.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Various preparations...
Please don't forget.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Hey, hey, that's kind of...
So half-hearted.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Of course!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
I wanted to fight {{Sin}} and...
I came all this way!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Even so...
Ah, damn!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
If you want to be recognized...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Huh?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
First, the assigned tasks...
Just try completing them silently.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
But even if you comply without a word...
No one will ever recognize you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Right? You think so too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Thinking it's someone else's problem...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Even a little bit of a Rule 42+53 violation...
First, you need to stand out...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Master {Luzzu} 42+55. ...
I'll show them...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard from {Seymour}, but...
I truly didn't expect to meet you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

How nostalgic, {Auron}!
Has it been 10 years?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hah hah hah...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
One of the Four Masters, {Yevon2}.
Master {Wen Kinoc}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
{Yevon2}'s warrior monks' commands and...
{Crusader}'s 42+57.42+58. is correct, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
That all operation preparations are complete...
A report was received.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kinoc} 
Understood.
Withdraw.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Huh!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kinoc} 
Hey, {Auron}.
What were you doing these past 10 years?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
The operation will begin.
That kind of talk is unnecessary.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kinoc} 
It's an operation that will fail anyway.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kinoc} 
Even a little longer.
I'll let you dream.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Awful!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymour} 
{Maester Kinoc} 
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kinoc} 
Ah, begin.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
To think that's the Master...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kinoc} 
I heard you, {Auron}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kinoc} 
A lot has happened in the past ten years.
Where were you and what were you doing?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
I was fulfilling the promise to 42+60.
...It's not over yet.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kinoc} 
Tell me one thing.
Did you see {Zanarkand}?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
Stay by {Yuna}'s side.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kinoc} 
Watching from a special 42+61. seat?
That's the Master's 42+62. privilege.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
It's as if the temple approved...
...some kind of strategy, isn't it...?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Since we don't know what will happen,
just be ready for battle.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I'm nervous...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Somehow... it feels comfortable.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Shall we begin soon?
--------------------------------------------------End--

To the {Al Bhed} tribe waiting outside,
We must relay the order to start the operation.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This place isn't safe either.
Monsters might come.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When preparations for battle are complete,
Please tell me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Is everyone ready?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please hurry.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I will see {Maester Kinoc} off.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Will 『{Sin} 』 come, I wonder?
--------------------------------------------------End--

To reclaim 『{sinspawn} 』.
They will surely come.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Let's be absolutely certain.
Make the kokera emit 悲42+63..
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
Even without doing that,
『{Sin} 』 will come...
--------------------------------------------------End--

『{Sin} 』 is my father.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What {Auron} said...
I remembered...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
They're coming!!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
Welcome.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
It'll sell no matter how high you price it.
42+64.42+65. is incredible, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
Oh, no, you're this way.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
{O'aka}, please!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Until {Operation Mi'ihen} is carried out.
Only a short time remains!
{NEWPAGE}

The fate of {Spira} rests on us, the {Crusader}...
...our performance in battle!
{NEWPAGE}

Fulfill our 42+66. as soldiers,
Today, we shall strike down '{Sin} '!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Huh!
--------------------------------------------------End--

With that, how many 42+67. 42+68.escapes has it been?
Five times...or is it six?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Captain is so 42+69.42+70. and...
...he keeps repeating the same story.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Encouraging the troops is a great 42+71. endeavor.
Just in case, should I do one more 42+67. 42+68.escape...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The start of the operation is nearing.
Please do not leave the command center.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To a place out of our 42+72. sight,
...it would be 42+73. if you went out.
--------------------------------------------------End--

With the ancient machine.
Make the operation succeed...
{NEWPAGE}

The teaching that forbids machines
I'll prove that it's wrong.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{summoner}...
Shall I report it later?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Together with those temple people,
my mood worsens.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Are these weapons free of abnormalities?
I am currently confirming.
--------------------------------------------------End--

After all, it's a machine from {Al Bhed}...
I must be extremely cautious.
--------------------------------------------------End--

From what I've seen, there seem to be no abnormalities, but...
I'll check a little more.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What's wrong! With that kind of strike,
it won't work against monsters!
{NEWPAGE}

Aren't you going to avenge your sister!?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Come on, think of me as a monster and
come at me!!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I will definitely defeat '{Sin} '!
I absolutely cannot forgive this...
{NEWPAGE}

I'll definitely, definitely defeat it...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hmph! Damn it!

These cannons were provided by {Al Bhed2}
free of charge.
{NEWPAGE}

I used to dislike them, but
I've started to see them in a new light.
--------------------------------------------------End--

With these cannons, we can attack from a distance.
We'll unleash a rain of shells upon 『{Sin} 』.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Only a very small portion of volunteers
can become Chocobo cavalry.

Whether their riding skills are exceptional, or on the battlefield
Only allowed to those who have achieved merit.
{NEWPAGE}

The most capable of the current Chocobo Knights is...
Of course, it's {Lucil}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

But still... why did {Clasko} become such a proud
Chocobo Knight, I wonder...
{NEWPAGE}

Certainly, with any Chocobo,
they quickly become friends, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--

This operation was devised by researching the actions of the ancient 『{Sin} 』.
This operation was devised by researching the actions of the ancient 『__P0__ 』.
{NEWPAGE}

『{Sin} 』 has a tendency for 『{sinspawn} 』
to appear where it is located.
{NEWPAGE}

So, we gather 『{sinspawn} 』 from various locations,
hurt them to lure out 『{Sin} 』...
{NEWPAGE}

and deliver the finishing blow with an ancient machine!
It's called 【{Operation Mi'ihen} 】!!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Our objective as {Crusader} is to lure out 『{Sin} 』
and hold them back.
{NEWPAGE}

Entrusting the finishing blow to {Al Bhed} people is
a little difficult, but...
{NEWPAGE}

If we can defeat 『{Sin} 』, then such a thing...
Small things don't matter.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There are many things I'm lacking.
I'm quickly buying everything I need.
{NEWPAGE}

But... it's too expensive compared to usual.
I have a feeling...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, since they're opening [42+87.] in a place like this...
...it can't be helped, I guess.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Shopping, shopping!
--------------------------------------------------End--

That [42+88.] person... is clearly...
...overcharging.
{NEWPAGE}

Because there's nowhere else to buy from...
...it seems they're taking advantage of us.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Can you lower the [42+89.]?
I tried asking, but...
{NEWPAGE}

They told me, "To 'lose' before an operation...
...is bad for [42+90.] fortune."
--------------------------------------------------End--

If that [42+88.] person gets caught up in battle...
...what do they intend to do, I wonder?
