Datto.
Winning streak! Winning streak!
I'll achieve a winning streak no matter what!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto.
Tooh!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto.
Haa!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto.
Fuu!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto.
I'll do my best to achieve a winning streak!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Reti!
Should I practice foot passes too?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}That's right.
{CHOICE:31}No, continue.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Reti!
Well then, from now on, these hands are feet!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Reti!
Got it!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Reti!
I'll master hand techniques!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Jash
I'm tired of pass practice.
I want to do shoot practice too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Jash
He's very bad at foot techniques.
{NEWPAGE}
Jash
And the one who gets dragged along is...
It's always me.
{NEWPAGE}
Jash
Haa...
--------------------------------------------------End--

What?
Do you want to use the Tendokyou?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30} Yeah.
{CHOICE:31}No, not really.
--------------------------------------------------End--

No, I won't lend it because you'll throw it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I see.
--------------------------------------------------End--

All those people are Summoners-sama.
It must be {Yevon2}'s guidance.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If she is {Braska}-sama's daughter...
There's no way 『{Sin}』 can't be defeated.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Since it's a valuable body, for `42+53.42+54.`...
Please be very careful.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Reti!
They're incredibly popular, aren't they?
In contrast, as for us...
--------------------------------------------------End--
Jash
Don't get down, I told you!
It's the usual, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Um, is it okay if we record spheres together?
Even just a signature is fine!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto.
So we don't lose to {Yuna}-chan.
We'll do our best too!
--------------------------------------------------End--

If Summoner-sama shows us energetic `42+55.42+56.`...
We citizens also get inspired by `42+57.`, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yay! Yay!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yay! Flying boat in the sky~!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Heh heh!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey!
--------------------------------------------------End--

At least a little of your big sister's...
Watch your big sister and learn!
--------------------------------------------------End--

How long are you going to keep doing the same thing?!
Enough already!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I get it, so just a little...
How about you calm down a little?!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Come down!
--------------------------------------------------End--

What's making you so happy?!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh, I get it, I get it.
It's fun! It's happy!
--------------------------------------------------End--

...Why suddenly...
did you lose interest?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Recently, strange shadows have been flying in the sky...
It seems concerned, so it won't come down.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You won't get eaten or anything, so...
Come down, I said!
--------------------------------------------------End--

So there really are such things as flying ships.
I thought I was dreaming again.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Come on, how long will you wait?
No more ships will come flying!
--------------------------------------------------End--

This {S.S. Liki} is under {Yevon2} Temple's
patronage and is being operated.
{NEWPAGE}

Even if you bring 42+59.s aboard,
it won't cost even 1 Gil.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do you like 42+59.s?
{NEWPAGE}

I love them very much.
{NEWPAGE}

So cute~
--------------------------------------------------End--

From now on, leisurely with the 42+59.s,
I hope we can take boat trips.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hope the temple's higher-ups work hard,
and protect {Spira}'s peace.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Flying ships are outrageous!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because such a ship flew,
my 42+59.s got scared!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You, that time...
You were aboard when '{Sin}' appeared, weren't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--

That incident was the trigger, and I...
...became afraid of the sea...
{NEWPAGE}

...of when '{Sin}' might appear again.
It's bothering me, I can't focus on my work.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It might be better to look for a new job on land...
...I suppose.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because I can't do any proper work.
That's why I'm on lookout like this.
--------------------------------------------------End--

While on lookout like this, right there...
...I feel like 『{Sin} 』 is about to show its face.
{NEWPAGE}

My trembling won't stop... It's not fear.
Any seaman would be appalled to hear that...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've been exposed to the wind all this time, but...
My 'poison' is persistent.
{NEWPAGE}

Every time I close my eyes, the form of 『__P0__ 』 that attacked this ship...
...appears in my mind.
{NEWPAGE}

Perhaps 『{Sin} 』 has possessed me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't manage a sailor's work like this.
Should I get off the ship and go on a temple pilgrimage or something?
--------------------------------------------------End--

If only 『{Sin} 』 would disappear...
...then I'll have no reason to fear the sea.
{NEWPAGE}

Again, like before, a proper...
...seaman I can become.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I could almost pray to the people on the flying ships.
To quickly defeat {Sin}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I die, I want it to be with a bang and grandly.
I want {Farplane} to 42+69. me.
{NEWPAGE}

Mmm, with {Luca Stadium} for me alone.
I suppose I'll have that done.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When they see how I die, the great 42+70. will shed 42+71..
If they shed them, it'll be a death worth dying for.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, for me to be 42+69.ed by {Farplane}...
That's still far, far in the future, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Come to think of it, what happened to the Grand Summoner's 42+72. and Master's...
...42+73. talks?
{NEWPAGE}

So, in the end, did it fall through?
What? How dull...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lately, it's been nothing but dull stories.
It's depressing, I can't stand it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When Nagi 42+74. comes, everyone will wholeheartedly...
...be able to get absorbed in Blitz.
{NEWPAGE}

Tsk... Retiring as a player...
It seems I retired a little too early.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A time comes for even the strongest players to retire.
So, even {Sin} will 42+75. the field.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Despite bringing them here to 42+77 the 42+76.shell...
Those kids are in a field trip mood!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Little kids, once they learn one fun thing,
They just endlessly 42+78. it, honestly!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Those kids have learned a new 42+79.
The day they'll 42+77 the 42+76.shell seems far off, doesn't it...
--------------------------------------------------End--

That's right, isn't it~
--------------------------------------------------End--

Tachi's 惠い42+63.42+64.
Please stop it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Watching those people,
I'm starting to feel somewhat empty.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do you know the monk-soldiers swarmed {Besaid Island}?
Apparently, they went to search for rebels.
{NEWPAGE}

The people of __P0__ said nothing, apparently.
Because I saw a flying ship.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Besaid} の人たちは なにも
しゃべらなかったそうよ
--------------------------------------------------End--

空飛ふ船が見えたから
I sang with all my might, but...
{NEWPAGE}

In the middle of a sea like this,
I wonder if my song will reach anyone.
--------------------------------------------------End--

All that's left is for '{Sin}' to disappear,
Just to pray earnestly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

42+80.person was a Blitz player in the past.
I was a keeper too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

In both games and life, we
are the best partners.
--------------------------------------------------End--

42+80.person was the best {blitzball}
player.
{NEWPAGE}

Well then, compared to {Luca Goers}'s Biksune 42+81.,
we're no match, even if we team up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Bevelle} seems to be 42+82.gashii.
Oh no, I wonder what happened.
--------------------------------------------------End--

42+80.person was a Blitz player in the past, and
they never retired, even after reaching 42+83..
{NEWPAGE}

They would easily defeat players who were 42+85.i,
about the age of their own children.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Actually, I was one of them.
Heh heh... I'll leave the rest to your imagination.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ever since being {42+67} by {{Sin}}
That {42+86} is utterly spiritless...
{NEWPAGE}

He used to be so dependable, but now...
He just keeps looking at the sea with frightened eyes.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That guy probably caught {{Sin}}'s poisonous influence,
fell victim to it.
{NEWPAGE}

If he just {42+87} the {42+65}, he'll surely recover, I believe.
We have no choice but to believe, right...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ever since he was {42+67} by {{Sin}}, that {42+86}...
started to fear the sea.
{NEWPAGE}

I can't believe it. Since he was a kid...
that guy, who has lived by the sea...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The reason that guy became spiritless is...
it's {{Sin}}'s poisonous influence.
--------------------------------------------------End--

After seeing the flying ship's battle...
that {42+86} also cheered up a bit.
{NEWPAGE}

If {{Sin}} disappears...
he too will surely {42+88}, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Truly, the flying ship is a godsend.
That is precisely P0's essence, isn't it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you're going to rest, please stay downstairs.
We'll be there by the time you wake up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Apparently, they're a great summoner from an amazing bloodline.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yes, she's P0-sama's daughter.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Amazing...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
P0-sama's daughter?
--------------------------------------------------End--

P0-sama's daughter, is it?
They might do it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Safely to P0.
I will pray.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Not P0-sama's daughter, but...
Why don't you call me P0?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hmm, P0-sama, is it...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Then, for P0-sama's safety...
Let me pray.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Oh, right, nothing at all...
I hadn't explained anything.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
We're going to an island called {Blue}【{Kilika} 】{White} now.
There, we'll change ships and head for P0.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
And before that, P0 is at the island's temple.
I will pray, so I will stand guard.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
At the temple, {Besaid Aurochs}'s...
I'll also do a certain victory pra42+93.yer, so you come along too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
An inco42+94.mplete plan.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
An efficient plan, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Don't push it on me.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Is the departed {Yuna} famous?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
It's Grand Summoner {Braska}-sama's 42+72.
There was a holy image in the temple, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
They defeated '{Sin}' 10 years ago.
Grand Summoner {Braska}-sama.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
{Yuna} as a summoner...
Has inherited the best blood.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
…It's a pity, isn't it, for one's passing to be famous.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
From this person, that kind of imagination...
It's useless to expect.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
I'll remember it, {Lulu}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
By the way, did you talk with {Yuna}?
They seemed eager to ask many things.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Who are you, truly...?
I wonder where they came from...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
If you interfere with {Yuna}'s journey,
You won't get off lightly.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
Hey, 42+95.Shifuri!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Oh! So you really...
Did you quit the cavalry?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
Yeah, well...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
{Elma} ridiculed me, but...
Captain {Lucil} understood me.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
Now, on this ship, I'm the Chocobo...
...42+96.42+97.attendant.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
Oh, becoming the 42+96.42+97.attendant...
...it was really great.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
I'm always with the Chocobos,
It's like... 42+98.heaven, you know?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
It's all thanks to hearing your 42+99.advice.
Really, thank you!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Well, I guess that's fine, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
That's right!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
The other day, inside the Chocobo 42+90.42+100.,
I found something like this.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
There's no point in me having 42+101 anyway.
I'll give it to you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
Oh, I should get going soon.
It's almost feeding time.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
What is it? You're a 42+95., after all.
At least wait a bit for your meal.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
It's not 42+101., it's the chocobos' feeding time!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
If they get hungry...
That would be pitiful, wouldn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
See ya!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just listen!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}It's fine.
{CHOICE:31}No, I don't.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just now, a strange 42+76.-like fellow...
...I met on the ship, and...
{NEWPAGE}

That guy, to me...
What do you think he said?
{NEWPAGE}

Suddenly, he said, 'This won't do!'
{NEWPAGE}

Isn't that awful?
I'm still very capable!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You think so too, don't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}That's right.
{CHOICE:31}I wonder...
--------------------------------------------------End--

That's right. That's how it is.
His eyes were rotten, weren't they?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Argh! So frustrating!
You, get out of here!
--------------------------------------------------End--

At least you could listen to me...
Wouldn't it be fine?!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Honestly, I'm so 42+88.frustrated!
I'm not going inside the ship anymore!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder if those two are Sako?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}It's Sako, right?
{CHOICE:31}It seems 42+102.42+103.so.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Are you resting?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}I'm not resting.
{CHOICE:31}I'm resting.
