{O'aka} 
Honesty is {O'aka}'s motto.
Pleased to meet you!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
Oh...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
Do you have anything, {CHOICE:30}?
I hope for a {CHOICE:31} Retten store.
It's nothing, {CHOICE:32}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
Welcome.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}, show me your weapons.
{CHOICE:31}, show me your items.
{CHOICE:32} I'll pass.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
{O'aka}, please!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
Good grief...
Travelers from {Guado} are shrewd.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
Dealing with customers visiting {Farplane},
they're conducting shady sales.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
Listen up.
Don't get swindled.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
And so...
--------------------------------------------------End--

To protect {Guado}'s chieftain,
I serve as a soldier.
{NEWPAGE}

Recently, I have been accompanying {Seymour}-sama.
I am traveling all over {Spira}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Seymour}-sama, in the coming {Spira},
will become the most important person.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We, the {Guado}, are originally from {Yevon2}.
I did not believe the teachings.
{NEWPAGE}

However, ever since the previous {Jyscal} clan leader,
our ties with the temple are only growing stronger.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Seymour}-sama, in {Macalania},
it is said that {Yevon2}-sama embraced the teachings of {Yevon2}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if {Seymour}-sama does not appear now,
I believe they will surely return.
{NEWPAGE}

To save us, or perhaps...
To destroy us, I don't know...
--------------------------------------------------End--

You are one of {Yuna}-sama's guards, aren't you?
What kind of 42+53. do you need?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30} Buy weapons.
{CHOICE:31} Buy items.
{CHOICE:32} I'll pass.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We don't have much decent 42+53., but...
If you like, please.
--------------------------------------------------End--

From now on, please continue to favor us 42+54. for a long time.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you feel like it, please come again.
--------------------------------------------------End--
