Tasugio
Two years ago, from afar at the stadium,
I was admiring your figure...
--------------------------------------------------End--
Tasugio
To meet you up close like this,
how magnificent you are－－
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna
Thank you very much.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Tasugio
Today, I have an inquiry regarding my shop,
--------------------------------------------------End--
Tasugio
My shop has joined the Youth Alliance.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Tasugio
Well, I suppose that Alliance isn't entirely without its merits, but
I, too, am a New Yevon 42+53. member, you see－－
--------------------------------------------------End--
Tasugio
Of course, my son 42+54.42+55. is the same. The shop, too, previously
was participating in meetings, but one day suddenly 42+56.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Tasugio
Because there are many 42+57. people in the Alliance, for the shop,
it might be stimulating and good, but－－
--------------------------------------------------End--

Since then, all over Spira, numerous
A group has been formed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

How should we create a new era?
What Spira should be like from now on－－
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone is searching for their own era.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Tasugio
－－The merchants are－－how should I put it...
I feel they are rushing too much－－
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because there are many ways of thinking, sometimes conflict also occurs.
It seems some people feel uneasy about an era like this.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Actually, I sometimes do too－－
--------------------------------------------------End--

But I'm living now, thinking this is okay.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna
I understand your feelings, but Tasugio.
Please try discussing with the merchants once.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna
It might seem risky from the outside, but.
Their feelings for Spira are surely the same.
--------------------------------------------------End--
