Summoner... this way?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
There are circumstances.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
I see……
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
The end of the highway is over there.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
However, due to an operation currently underway,
the path beyond the end point is closed.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
Whether the Summoner can pass or not,
please consult with the captain of Tenmon.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
You cannot return to the new road from this old road.
For now, please proceed to the end of the highway.

{Shelinda} 
The rumors about me
...seem to have spread...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
The people from {Crusader}
...are ignoring me...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
Going down to the old road
...was a mistake.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
There's little foot traffic, so
it won't be profitable.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
Hey, something...
...won't you buy something?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
{Crusader} is extremely enthusiastic, but
What's starting?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
Thanks, kid.
I won't forget you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
Well, I suppose so.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
You're lending money?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
What... Don't get my hopes up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I was training here before the operation...
I thought we would definitely win.
--------------------------------------------------End--

42+53.It's too much, isn't it...42+54.will end up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My Chocobo was defeated too.
Even though we've fought together all this time...

Lend {CHOICE:56} Gil to {O'aka}

{O'aka} 
……Hey, boy.
I appreciate the sentiment, but I don't have enough Gil.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
Oh, boy, even {VAR12:32} Gil...
Will you lend it to me?

Secluding myself in the temple and 42+57. is...
I decided to stop.
{NEWPAGE}

While traveling, I will interact with the people.
I intend to convey my teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--

First, I will learn {Al Bhed}'s 42+58. words, and...
I intend to try talking with 42+59. them.
{NEWPAGE}

Just by 42+60. those 42+59. who don't pray...
Nothing will be solved.
--------------------------------------------------End--

『{Sin} 』 is apparently still not dead.
They are tenacious!
{NEWPAGE}

If we had the cannon we used during the operation...
We could have taken an aimed shot...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Maybe I can be of some help.
I'll try going to {Bevelle} too!
--------------------------------------------------End--

There are quite a lot of people evacuating from {Bevelle}.
{NEWPAGE}

The people exhausted from their long journey, from monsters...
Protecting them is our duty.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Until a little while ago, warrior monks were along the highway...
guarding it, but...
{NEWPAGE}

They have gone somewhere.
They are utterly irresponsible.
