{Gatta} 
Hey!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Hey, I saw the match!
I was really moved!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
That's great, {Wakka}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
That's too bad, {Wakka}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
What are you doing slacking off?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
That is... um...
The Summoner's party...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
Having separate matters is fine, but
Operational preparations must be handled at once.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
You understand?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
Huh!
I have no 42+53. answer!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
I'm counting on you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
Listen, it's better to humble yourself before Yasunao.
That's how things will go well.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
I see……
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
{Yuna}-chan
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
We, from the temple...
I was expelled, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
I'll always be 42+54. supporting you.
That won't change, so remember that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Thank you.
{Luzzu}-san, {Gatta}-kun
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
But if it's possible...
Returning to {Besaid} like this...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Let's hurry! Onward, 42+55.!
--------------------------------------------------End--

If we defeat 『{Sin} 』, there won't be any problem, right?!
--------------------------------------------------End--

However, according to {Yevon2}'s teachings...
--------------------------------------------------End--

How persistent!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Persistent... is that it...?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Is something wrong?
--------------------------------------------------End--

A Summoner... is that what you are?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Yes, my name is {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's an honor to meet you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I am {Shelinda}.
I am serving as a 42+56. monk.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
The dispute was...
Is it about 42+57.'s {Crusader}'s plan?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
{Luzzu} and {Gatta} were talking about...
Is it about the grand plan?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
I heard they would use machines, and I wanted to somehow
stop it...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Huh? Why?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
It seems 42+58. are trying to use machines that the
temple prohibits.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
It's bad, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
You should use anything you can.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
I don't think we can defeat {Sin}, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
It's not a matter of whether we can defeat them or not.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
Going against the teachings is the problem.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Th-That's right...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
But everyone from {Crusader}...
They don't listen to anything I say.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
As a monk, I...
That's because I'm 末42+59.......
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Let's do our best!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I'm also a 42+60.け出し summoner,
I'm still a 末42+59. person.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
But if I call myself 末42+59....
if I said that...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
it seems like an excuse.
Don't you think so?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
That's right!
I need to be more steadfast!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
Thank you very much, Master {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
I feel like I can somehow manage.
(No translation for this line, combined with 1)
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
By doing my best at my 42+56.th monk duties...
Someday, I'll become a temple monk.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Since I'm giving you this,
please don't say anything about me trembling.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There are many monsters, so be careful.
Here, use it if things get dangerous.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you're prepared...
You should get ready with this.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's a morale boost before the mission!
Here you go, take it!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I bought too much before the mission...
If you like, please use it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I just joined {Crusader}.
(No translation for this line, combined with 15)
{NEWPAGE}

And then, suddenly such a big mission, right?
It's an honor, but my body's started trembling...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I-It's not fear, it's battle-shivers!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do you see that 42+61.board?
{NEWPAGE}

Making such a big show of their promotions.
Those guys are getting too carried away.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If we let those guys run wild...
Nothing good will come of it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The 42+62.i soldiers are confident of the 42+63. of the operation,
it seems, but...
{NEWPAGE}

Veterans who have gained 42+64.42+65.
are not holding 42+66.i expectations.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Of course, if it comes to fighting,
we'll give it our all and go for victory!
{NEWPAGE}

If we don't believe we can win,
we'll lose even battles we could have won.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even though it's said that victory depends on luck,
defeat is not allowed for us.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We'll defeat '{Sin}',
become a hero and return 42+68.42+69.!
--------------------------------------------------End--

We {Crusader}s will go down in 42+70.42+71.
We are trying to carry out an operation.
{NEWPAGE}

After all, for humans other than Summoners
to defeat '{Sin}' is a 42+71. first!
--------------------------------------------------End--

We're sure to win!
After all, we have 42+72. on our side.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When the operation begins, I too...
...will go to the front lines and fight.
{NEWPAGE}

I have overcome rigorous...
...training for this day.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even Lord/Lady {High Summoner Yocun}, who once defeated 『{Sin}』,
before becoming a Summoner, was a female soldier of {Crusader}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If I fight 42+74. bravely like Lord/Lady {Yocun}...
...will I receive {Yevon2}'s blessing...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Until just recently, the __P0__ heading to the operation...
...were coming and going, but...
{NEWPAGE}

It's become completely deserted now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Only the Summoner can defeat 『{Sin}』.
After all, {Yevon2}'s teachings are correct.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's peaceful and fine weather, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

When you reach my age, you won't be surprised by trifling matters.
You won't be surprised by trifling matters.
{NEWPAGE}

Even if 『{Sin}』 were to appear right now...
...we'll deal with it then.
{NEWPAGE}

Offer prayers as taught.
Go to {Farplane} obediently.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's peaceful and fine weather, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The injured people from {Crusader}
Many passed by.
{NEWPAGE}

Everyone hung their heads dejectedly.
It was too pitiful to watch.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I might have broken 42+75.the teachings, but...
How cruel...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I was thinking of joining {Crusader}, but...
It seems better to aim to become a warrior monk.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Things are going wrong with {Crusader}, and in {Bevelle}
...it seems there was 42+76.activity...
{NEWPAGE}

Somehow, the future feels uncertain...
The future is already unclear as it is.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What we can do is believe in Summoner-sama
...is that all? How powerless.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because {Home} was blown away.
I'm taking a walk to clear my head.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Walking is fun sometimes.
{NEWPAGE}

Sometimes written by {Al Bhed3}
Graffiti gets found sometimes, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What I'm saying,
You might not understand.
{NEWPAGE}

If I've wasted your time,
I apologize.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're looking quite gloomy.
That doesn't suit you under the blue sky.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I have a hard time,
I make a point of taking a walk here.
{NEWPAGE}

I breathe in the refreshing air,
And that's how I change my mood.
--------------------------------------------------End--

…But there are also times when nothing can be done, though.
(Combined with 12)
--------------------------------------------------End--

Around here, the number of {Al Bhed2} has increased, hasn't it?
Well, it's better than no one being here.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Still, I'm not good with {Al Bhed}.
{NEWPAGE}

I think they'd understand if you talked to them, but
After all, their words don't get through.
--------------------------------------------------End--

...Sorry.
I'm not really in the mood to talk right now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm fine, but just leave me alone...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I suffered a serious injury in the previous operation.
I couldn't move for a while, but...
{NEWPAGE}

Somehow I recovered and to guard duty on the highway.
was able to return.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We didn't have the power to defeat '{Sin}',
didn't have the strength, but...
{NEWPAGE}

everyone from monsters,
we can at least protect.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Rather than regretting what we couldn't do,
we'll just steadily do the work we can do.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone acts casually, but
they're always terrified of '{Sin}'.
{NEWPAGE}

We can't ever get used to it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Wanting to blow away my anxiety,
I sang a song of prayer in a loud voice.
{NEWPAGE}

At that time, I was almost desperate.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If I see a flying ship, I'll sing anything.
Because that's all I can do.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That flying ship, Nagi...
You're going to make it for me, aren't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if it's just for a moment of ナギ42+86.
I want to try living feeling truly at ease from my heart.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Until I 42+87. ナギ42+86., no matter what!
I will definitely survive!!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even though monsters appear on this road...
The number of people walking doesn't decrease, do they?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if they are 42+88. by '{Sin}' or monsters,
they have no choice but to keep walking.
{NEWPAGE}

If I think about it, the common people are quite...
tenacious.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That being said, the fact that monsters are 42+89.i...
hasn't changed, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I came to a place like this while taking a walk~, huh?
Where is this? Where where?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Someone's important-looking statue...
is 42+90. over there~, isn't it?
{NEWPAGE}

Maybe there's one just like it somewhere, huh?
Have you seen it before? Or not~?
--------------------------------------------------End--
