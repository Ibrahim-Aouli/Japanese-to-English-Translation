{Tidus} 
Is that {Djose}'s temple?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
Lord {Yuna}, everyone.
I'm glad you're safe.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
It's good that you are safe too...
It's Yevon's blessing, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
Our lives were spared, but...
As a fighting force, we're practically wiped out.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
The only Chocobo that survived is...
...this one.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
With this, we can't call ourselves a Chocobo Cavalry...
...we can't identify ourselves as such...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
After defying the teachings and joining the war...
...this is our plight.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
To the soldiers who died...
I can't face them.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
That's an early departure, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
Lord {Yuna} was {42+53} until so late...
...{42+54} even though... Are you alright?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Thank you for your concern.
But I've rested enough.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Are you also departing?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
Right! We'll cross {Moonflow} and head north.
We intend to search for a new Chocobo.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
Once a Chocobo is found...
We'll re-form the cavalry!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Huh?
Isn't someone missing?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
Captain!
Please wait!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
What are you doing?!
We'll leave you behind!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
But... with the Chocobo...
Following a Chocobo is impossible...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
Well then, Lord {Yuna}, good luck.
{Elma} {Clasko}, let's go!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
Yes!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
Eh!?
U-Um, just let me rest...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
Don't give up!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey! Rebels aren't welcome!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You all, don't approach the temple!
Go quickly!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Understand our feelings too!
Honestly, I don't want to do this!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're a rebel! ...Just kidding.
That was an outrageous rumor.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, it's 42+57.しふり.
How are you doing?
--------------------------------------------------End--

We are also 42+58.援.
Do your best!!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Stay well!
Please defeat 『{Sin} 』!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Come again anytime!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Stay well! We too
want to go 42+58.援 too!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
Before joining the operation.
I should have been calm...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
You're the only one left...
Let's do our best for everyone.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
After all, breaking the teachings
was wrong...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Machines cannot defeat {Sin}.
The only reliable one is the Summoner...
{NEWPAGE}

{Yevon2}'s teachings are correct.
The {Crusader} who defied was foolish.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Take this.
Because I won't use it anymore.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people have no choice but to live by following the teachings.
I was made to realize it by this 42+59. now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because {Crusader} broke 42+60.
I'll help with the temple's 42+61.bi for a while.
{NEWPAGE}

Us, who were excommunicated...
It's a 42+62. repayment for accepting us.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I... I'll quit {Crusader}.
I wonder if I should become a monk soldier or something.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple's 42+61.bi isn't easy either, is it?
{NEWPAGE}

I won't let monsters and rebels pass!
--------------------------------------------------End--

By the way, I heard that {Yuna}-sama is 42+63.
I was a fan, though...
{NEWPAGE}

Leave the 42+63. ceremony's 42+61.bi to me too, okay?
--------------------------------------------------End--

And the monk officials are dispirited.
Fewer people visit the temple.
{NEWPAGE}

But I 42+64.u, no matter what happens.
I decided to live according to the teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because the warrior monks went to {Bevelle}.
It's our 42+65.turn to protect this temple.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Myself, for having participated in such an operation...
I was 42+66.reproaching myself all 42+53.the while...
{NEWPAGE}

Then the Senior Monk advised me.
He told me to pray if I had time for regrets.
{NEWPAGE}

To comfort my subordinates from the otherworld.
It is my duty to offer prayers.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I received this from the Senior Monk, but...
It's probably the 42+68. that 42+67.should use.
--------------------------------------------------End--

As a humble offering to my fallen subordinates.
I must offer heartfelt prayers.

My 42+70.42+71. is the temple's 42+61. protection... That's what I decided.
I'm making an effort not to think about unnecessary things.
--------------------------------------------------End--

More than when I was formulating a plan to defeat '{Sin}'.
It is an arrangement 42+72. lacking in stimulation, isn't it?
{NEWPAGE}

A desire to lead my former subordinates and fight.
It's not that I don't have that feeling.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Recently, people who 42+73. defy the temple's policies.
It seems they're increasing... This is bad.
{NEWPAGE}

If they break the teachings and get carried away, once again...
A tragedy 42+74. like {Operation Mi'ihen} will occur.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What happened to {Crusader} who broke the teachings?
Did you forget? Even if you regret 42+75. in {Farplane}, it's too late!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people of {Crusader}, their own actions...
It seems they are 42+76. deeply 42+77. reflecting.
{NEWPAGE}

Therefore, we of the temple open our hearts,
and are considering forgiving 42+78. them.
{NEWPAGE}

Even {Crusader} is no different from the common people.
The temple will not abandon the common people.

Whenever you are hurt, come back to this temple.

Heal the weariness of your journey.

All I can do is offer prayers.
Let us believe in {Yevon2} until the very end.
