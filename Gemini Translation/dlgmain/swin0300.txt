Just as I said, against Gowars...
...they couldn't win, could they? Heheheh!
--------------------------------------------------End--

For {Aurochs} to win the championship...
...that's something that would never happen, even if Nagiten came a hundred times!
--------------------------------------------------End--

For *that* {Aurochs} to win the championship...
...what kind of cheating did they do?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, {Aurochs}'s lot, at best...
...they probably just had a good dream, didn't they?
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Al Bhed2} with a flying ship...
...attacked {Bevelle}, they say.
{NEWPAGE}

As a result, {Master Seymor}'s wedding ceremony...
...was apparently called off.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Those guys from {Al Bhed}, someone else's wedding...
...interfering with it, what do they find fun about that, I wonder?
--------------------------------------------------End--

If the temple is gone, this ferry also...
...might become unable to operate.
{NEWPAGE}

If I lose my job on the ship, in {Luca}...
...maybe I'll be a stadium [42+53.] security guard.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If I do a Blitz-related job, with Gowars...
...I might get to know them! Heheheheh!
--------------------------------------------------End--

We used to transport many of {Crusader}'s soldiers to {Operation Mi'ihen}, but...
Very few return from the operation.
{NEWPAGE}

It seems they were severely defeated.
Let us pray that the souls of the fallen may reach __P0__ unimpeded.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You know that {Farplane} passed away and __P1__ did `辞42+54.`, don't you?
Even __P0__ is said to be missing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple's `組42+55.` is in great disarray.
I had expected much from __P0__, so it's regrettable.
{NEWPAGE}

That person was genuinely trying to save {Master Seymor}, yet...
I hear __P0__ has passed away.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even the Grand Master cannot overcome death...?
Who will become the new Grand Master in place of Grand Master {Spira}...? It seems a `42+56.力42+57.い` is about to begin.

{Maester Mika2}: "__P1__ ラ__P2__ 42+59. __P3__ さ__P4__"

{Mika} 様に代わって 誰が新たな総老師に
なるか……42+56.力42+57.いが始まりそうだな
