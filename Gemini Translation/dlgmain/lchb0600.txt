`Priest officials from {Yevon2} Temple and {Al Bhed2}`
`{Crusader}, warrior monks, {Ronso}, and {Guado}...`
{NEWPAGE}

People, even those with differing circumstances and ways of thinking,
are amicably enjoying Blitz.
{NEWPAGE}

Such a wonderful place,
though {Spira} is vast, this is the only place.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Regarding the duty to protect this place,
I hold pride in it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even though the Grand Master is here,
we don't have enough help for the preparations.
{NEWPAGE}

Until last year's tournament, {Crusader}
helped us, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The tournament that the people throughout {Spira} eagerly awaited...
There likely won't be any scoundrels to interfere.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because {Crusader} neglected the preparations,
we ended up allowing the monsters' intrusion.
{NEWPAGE}

If there's time to work on a futile strategy,
I wish they would help with the preparations.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Crusader} is really something.
That kind of strategy will never succeed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't want to leave the preparations for the spectator seats to the warrior monks.
Because they are so rigid.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The monk soldiers are gone, but {Crusader}...
They are helping us respond.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When the flying ship flew in...
Both the spectators and players were so excited, it was quite a scene.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Why is the player here!?
Go support your teammates from the bench!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Player {Wakka} is quite worn out.
It might be impossible for him to appear in the finals.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even though such an incident just happened...
I didn't think it would get this chaotic.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Aurochs}'s consecutive first-round elimination record has stopped...
It's a shame. It was a record that would remain in history.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if the tournament ends, there are matches every day.
The staff has no time to rest.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It truly is a depraved city, isn't it...
I've lost the will to return to Bevelle.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's not a match worth watching so intently.
This year too, {Aurochs}'s first-round elimination is a given.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Aurochs} has given it his all.
He probably doesn't have the strength left to fight in the finals.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because of the monster's 42+55.movement.
It turned into a tournament with a bad aftertaste...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I was here for {Master Seymor}'s summoned beast.
I was watching. No, it was great 42+71.power!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Summoners who go missing during their 42+72.journey
are many because the guards are incompetent.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm off-duty now.
Let me relax.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Aren't you competing?
You're quite confident for a {Aurochs}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That {Aurochs} making it to the finals...
Am I just dreaming...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The tournament is over, but
matches are held 42+57.days.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Maester Mika2} has already to {Bevelle}.
returned, I hear.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Master Seymor} in {Operation Mi'ihen}.
defeated '{sinspawn}', I hear.
--------------------------------------------------End--

After a long boat trip, you watch Blitz
and forget your 42+56.work42+73. fatigue. That's the idea.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Al Bhed}'s player moves well.
These are the movements of one certain of victory.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I was impressed by {Aurochs}'s fighting spirit.
They will not be outdone even by {Ronso}'s [42+75.] warriors.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The [42+75.] of {Ronso} make their horns large.
The people of {Luca} make Blitz important.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If they are people who uphold {Yevon2}'s teachings...
They will not develop in {Crusader}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Only {Guado2} and the monk-soldiers are guarding the main road.
Why do you not ask {Ronso} for cooperation?
--------------------------------------------------End--

What a lot of people...
It's completely different from {Calm Lands}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I decided to stay in {Luca} until Nagi [42+77.] comes.
I want to be with many people.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sykes and {Aurochs} alike.
It is not {Ronso Fangs}'s enemy.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It is {Aurochs}'s victory.
It is truly {Yevon2}'s blessing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Many {Ronso} attacked {Luca}.
It is to protect Spirit [42+79.] {Gagazet}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Yevon2} Temple's 42+69.42+70. is long, but
It's the first time a summoner has become a master.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The expedition members are also enjoying the match.
I hope the pain of defeat will ease.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've seen many things in the {Spira} sea, but
There was a 42+80. on the flying ship at Port 1.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's a flying ship near the port.
I wonder what happened to the battle with '{Sin}'.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Announcer
Even so, who on earth!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Announcer
Who would predict this combination
I wonder?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Announcer
Against the undefeated {Luca Goers} in the final match...
The one they will face is......
--------------------------------------------------End--
Announcer
The team always eliminated in the first round.
{Besaid Aurochs} ！！
--------------------------------------------------End--
Liberated One
Indeed, this is a 42+80. extraordinary upset, isn't it?
