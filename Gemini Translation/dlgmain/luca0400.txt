If 'Sin' disappears, Spira's seas will
become calm too, won't they?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't say it loudly, but the temples lately are
strange! ...Oops, I spoke too loudly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Every time I hear someone's marriage story, I think it's about time for me too...
Well, it's just a thought, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If I keep thinking "just one more store, just one more store,"
I'll never be able to stop.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I couldn't get a ticket,
so I was watching the match here.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thanks to that, I wasn't
attacked by monsters.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's a blessing in disguise. This is also
{Yevon2}'s gift... perhaps?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I want to gather as many comrades as possible
and re-form the subjugation squad.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Giving up on the subjugation squad
and becoming a monk warrior might be good too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Spira} is full of monsters.
It wouldn't be strange if anywhere were attacked.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To think I'd be invited to the extermination squad.
I wasn't expecting it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The desire to protect people...
Warrior monks and the extermination squad are the same.
--------------------------------------------------End--

In short, what's certain is...
...not a single thing is understood, then.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Nagi-ō soon, huh...? Passed away...
Grand Maester Maika, too, must be satisfied in the Farplane.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's no way the Great Summoner's daughter would rebel.
I wonder what the temple misunderstood.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Maester Seymour is going to break ties, then...?
Oh, what a waste.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because there are warrior monks all over town...
It feels like 42+53.42+54. has been done to me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Master Seymor} was amazing, wasn't it?
It's the first time I've seen a summon like that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If someone of that caliber is a Maester...
I want to believe that {Spira} is also 平42+55.......

Is Lady Yuna a rebel? Or isn't she?
It's nothing but vague rumors, so I can't tell.

Maester Seymour and Lady Yuna's ceremony...
It will become a 42+60. magnificent wedding ceremony that will be remembered 42+58.42+59..
--------------------------------------------------End--

It looks difficult for the Crusaders to 42+61. recover.
I wonder what will happen now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're the player from 42+62. {Aurochs}, aren't you?
You were amazing this time!
--------------------------------------------------End--

After 23 consecutive years of first-round defeats, suddenly...
So something like a 42+63. victory really can happen, huh?
--------------------------------------------------End--

You couldn't achieve a 42+63. victory, but it was a great 42+64. fight!
Keep up the good work!

Please let me rest a little.

Just when the Grand Maester had arrived...
Because a monster disturbance broke out...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The preparatory staff collapsed from mental strain.
The tournament operating committee is in chaos.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Scoop! The one on the flying ship is...
It's said to be Lord Braska's daughter!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Guado tribe, the Al Bhed's dwelling...
They apparently utterly destroyed it. How terrible.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Maester's ceremony at Luca Stadium...
I think it would get more exciting if we did it there.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Summoners all over Spira...
...are apparently going missing.

It was amazing when the flying ship arrived~!
It was a commotion of shouting and singing, wasn't it!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple is in a commotion? Hmm...
We staff are completely occupied with Blitz.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Quit the extermination squad and help with the stadium's work?
I wonder if there's anyone who would help.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The operation failed, I hear...
After all, machine weapons won't work, will they?
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's the stadium repairs. Haa...

It is 42+79. Please use it with great 42+77.!

Welcome!
Player Blitz is fine 42+80.42+81.

No matter how weak, a player is a player!
Do your best! I'm 42+66.supporting you!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple has become dilapidated, and...
I want to quit being a warrior monk already...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Then join the subjugation squad!
If it's you, you'll be fine 42+80.42+81.

Nonsense. When we 42+84.ed...
We're in the same boat.

That monster is {Al Bhed}'s doing!
It's harassment toward the temple!
--------------------------------------------------End--

What are you saying? If it's {Al Bhed}...
...they'd obviously use machines.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh... I see.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That monster is {Crusader}'s doing!
It's harassment toward the tournament!

There's absolutely no logic.
Zero comprehension.

Why are you silent, {Kimahri}? We haven't met for 10 years.
Why can't I see {Yenke}?

Have you forgotten {Yenke}?
Have you forgotten Elder Brother {Biran}?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Biran} 
Don't underestimate {Yenke}!
{Kimahri} is a small {Ronso}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Biran} 
You're short. I can't see your face.
I can't tell {Biran} and {Yenke} apart.

Uwahahahaha!

Have you forgotten {Ronso}'s compatriot, you ignorant one!
I doted on you when your horns were regrowing!

Elder Brother {Biran} trained {Kimahri}.
Raised you into a strong {Ronso}.

You're a good player, but...
You're still lacking effort.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you want to get that,
You have to win more.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You've become an amazing player.
--------------------------------------------------End--

All that's left is if you bring that.
I'll give you our family treasure.

Hey! Star player!

You have that.
Show it to me for a bit.

Yes, yes, that's it, that!
But that still lacks power.

Too bad! If that were filled with power...
I'd give you our family treasure...

Lord Oharand used this.
It is a historically significant ball.
