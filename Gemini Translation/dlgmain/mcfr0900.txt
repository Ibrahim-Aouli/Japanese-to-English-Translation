I was supposed to meet my family here, but...
I can't find them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They're so absent-minded, so...
Did they get the meeting place wrong?
--------------------------------------------------End--

What!? Is that right!?
My apologies, young man!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I am tired from a long journey.
Please leave me be.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh? You are {Besaid Aurochs}'s...
...a player, aren't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh... so you are a player.
If that's the case, I have an important matter.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To you, the player, representing {Guado}...
...I felt I must apologize.
{NEWPAGE}

The monster that left the stadium after the finals...
That was {Guado2}'s doing.
{NEWPAGE}

It completely ruined a match typical of Taiou.
We truly did something inexcusable.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Releasing the monster in {Luca Stadium}...
...was something Lord {Seymour} planned.
{NEWPAGE}

If monsters are defeated by summoned beasts, Lord {Seymour}'s
popularity would increase... that was the goal.
{NEWPAGE}

Considering a tie with the Great Summoner's daughter was also
perhaps to win over the people of {Yevon2}.
{NEWPAGE}

It seemed there were other reasons too, but
at this point, I don't know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Due to obeying Lord {Seymour}, {Guado2}
has committed an unpardonable sin.
{NEWPAGE}

Now, to say 'It's Lord {Seymour}'s fault,'
even if I make excuses, no one will be convinced.
{NEWPAGE}

The whole of {Guado2}, like {Al Bhed2},
will probably come to be blamed...
--------------------------------------------------End--

That child's brother was a subordinate of Lord {Seymour}.
{NEWPAGE}

Searching for the missing summoner, he raided {Al Bhed2}'s
hideout... and died.
{NEWPAGE}

Not even sent to the otherworld, he must have become a monster by now
and be wandering...
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Guado2}'s power has greatly weakened,
and the clan merely awaits destruction.
{NEWPAGE}

Therefore, I am taking that child...
I left {Guadosalam}.
{NEWPAGE}

Moving to and settling in some distant land,
I intend to live quietly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To that child, I still haven't told the truth of {Guado}.
...I haven't told yet.
{NEWPAGE}

When that child matures, the weight of the truth...
...when they become able to accept...
{NEWPAGE}

I intend to tell everything anew...
...I am thinking.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've talked for a long time and become tired.
Please let me rest a little...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Grandmother has an important story...
...I hear.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My older brother fought against the Megumi nasty people and...
...achieved an honorable death in battle.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I dislike the current {Guadosalam}.
Everyone is only making gloomy faces...
{NEWPAGE}

That's why, with Grandmother,
we set out on a journey.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Until Grandmother recovers her spirits.
I will rest here.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30} I was waiting over there.
{CHOICE:31} I hope we can meet.
--------------------------------------------------End--
