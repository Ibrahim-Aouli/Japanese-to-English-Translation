The first match has already begun.
Please hurry to your own seats.

The monster's 42+53.42+54. is currently undergoing 調42+55..

Even if you are a rebel.
Luca 42+58. The people are always on the players' side.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The prayer song that everyone in the stadium sang...
...is still echoing in my ears.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Did you leave something behind when you ran away?
You'd better give up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even though there's a match happening right nearby...
...not being able to watch is tough.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The spectator seats that the monsters destroyed...
...we struggled to repair them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even after the tournament ends, the stadium is full.
After all, Luca is the city of Blitz!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Most of the warrior monks retreated to Bevelle 42+60., but...
...some stayed because they liked Luca's free 42+57. atmosphere.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The next Grand Maester hasn't been decided yet, right? For next year's tournament...
...I wonder who I should ask to preside 42+61. over the opening ceremony...
--------------------------------------------------End--

This stadium is integrated with the port,
and has a composite 42+62.42+63. structure.
{NEWPAGE}

Therefore, there's no need to worry about getting lost!
If you go this 42+64. way, you will reach {Blue} [Port {VAR12:30}] {White}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The opening ceremony will begin shortly, so...
Contestants, please wait in the waiting room.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A contestant... that can't be right.
The match has already started.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Where the monster appeared from...
It's still under inves42+55.tigation.
{NEWPAGE}

I cannot provide a direct answer, but...
Please wait for the official announcement.

Once this tournament ends, the operation will begin.
Fun will have to wait for a while.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Also, in order to enjoy Blitz again...
I hope to ac42+66.complish the operation and sur42+67.vive.
--------------------------------------------------End--

By Master Kinoc's order, Ruca...
I'll protect you. Be grateful!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even with hardships, enjoy Blitz.
To let it go... The people of Luca are truly strong.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Until the 42+68. year's tournament, the expeditionary force...
was in charge of 42+69. preparations, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Currently, the expeditionary force is on an operation, so...
This year's tournament, the 42+58. people are making 42+69. preparations.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm relieved the Grand Maester is safe.
{Master Seymor}'s 42+66.42+72., isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even though many expeditionary force members just died...
The stadium is full...? What an appalling town.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Luca's 42+73. people are donating 42+74. money.
are supporting the expeditionary force.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The 42+76. championship is definitely the Goers', right?
The other teams... they're just 42+77. defeated ones.
--------------------------------------------------End--

For the tournament to end because of such a 42+71. incident!
Somehow, it just doesn't feel right.
--------------------------------------------------End--

'Sin' was apparently defeated by machines and returned to the sea.
With this, it might become a little more 42+78. peaceful.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I decided to join the expeditionary force.
It's uncool to just be idly protected, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard! 'Sin' fell on Bevelle!
That means Nagi42+79. is coming soon~!!
--------------------------------------------------End--

42+80.round 42+69.security is currently in progress.
If you see any un42+81.persons, please report them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because the temple's warrior monks will 42+82.assist with the 42+69.security.
Our 42+71.work is quite a lot easier, too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The extermination squad will 42+82.assist with the 42+69.security.
We can't be outdone either!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I couldn't get tickets this year...
Oh well. I'll watch it at the cafe while having a 42+83.drink.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Maester Mika2}, after the tournament,
Apparently, {Bevelle} returned immediately to {Bevelle}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard there's a plan for the warrior monks to 42+69.guard the liaison ship.
I don't know if it's 42+84.kindness or meddling.
--------------------------------------------------End--

After all, for the city of Luca, more than warrior monks,
The extermination squad is more 42+85.fitting.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hope this 42+86.Nagi42+79. will last a long time.
Three years... no, at least one year...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I got to watch the recent 42+87.broadcast.
Heh... Do your best.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You were quite active, weren't you?
You certainly lived up to your big talk.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I liked your play.
Please participate in many matches from now on.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, when is your next appearance?
I'm looking forward to your turn.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When 'Shin' is gone, participate in matches every day, won't you?
Then I'll just end up coming to watch.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The opening ceremony will begin soon.
Contestants, please wait in the waiting room.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When a monster appeared, if {Master Seymor}
wasn't there... even imagining it is scary.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ultimately, who released the monster in the stadium,
is still unknown... it seems to be an unsolved mystery.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Did you know? You are being treated as a rebel,
but because of that, you're actually gaining popularity.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This year, we will support Albedo Sykes.
The subjugation squad is indebted to the Albedo tribe.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We will depart for the operation soon.
It's farewell to {Luca}'s town, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

My captain is pushing tasks onto me...
...while they're watching Blitz.
--------------------------------------------------End--

After the operation, I quit the extermination squad, but I rejoined.
Fighting in the extermination squad suits me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Until monsters are gone from Spira,
I intend to fight in the extermination squad.
--------------------------------------------------End--

During the tournament, even ships won't move.
I'll rest my bones on land until the next 42+91.!
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Sin} is lurking in the nearby sea.
The ferry will be out of 42+92.42+91. for a while!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The ferry has resumed 42+91.s.
It suddenly got 42+93., and it's tough.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The flying ship at Port 1 is a legendary airship.
I thought it was a fairy tale, but to think it actually existed...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Actually, I already have to go to the operation site, but...
At least I want to watch the opening ceremony.
--------------------------------------------------End--

So that people won't have to fear monsters,
{Crusader} will carry out a major operation.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you see anyone suspicious,
Please report them immediately!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Once preparations are made at Luca, the extermination squad will advance to the Mi'ihen Highroad.
Advance and exterminate the monsters all at once is the plan!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're a player, aren't you? Don't just stand around.
Check the tournament rules now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The tournament ended, and I should have been able to relax, but...
I'm extremely busy with the investigation of monster incidents.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple went out of its way to protect the stadium, specifically...
They kindly sent monk soldiers. That was a great help.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The monk soldiers are gone, but the extermination squad...
returned to guard duty. It's Yevon's blessing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When the Calm comes, we must hold a commemorative tournament!
Actually, we have already started preparations.
