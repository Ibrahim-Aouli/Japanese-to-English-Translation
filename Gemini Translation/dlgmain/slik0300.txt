What nice weather~
The wind must feel good.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Want to try holding the ship's helm?
…Just kidding. It's a joke.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're {Yuna}-sama's…
…comrade, aren't you?
{NEWPAGE}

So that means, a guard?
People aren't judged by their appearance, are they?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I think I'll also go talk with {Yuna}-sama later.
For safety during the voyage, warrior monks…
--------------------------------------------------End--

…there was talk of boarding the ship.
But the captain refused.
{NEWPAGE}

Saying they would protect themselves with their own strength.
This ship survived even after being affected by 『__P0__』.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's a lucky ship. You can depart by sea with peace of mind.
Things are chaotic on land, but…
--------------------------------------------------End--

On the sea, it's irrelevant.
Even if 『__P0__』 appears…
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'll just follow the captain.
オレは船長についてくだけさ
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if it's a machine that defies the teachings...
I want to try piloting a flying ship.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder what kind of person the captain of a flying ship is.
I wonder if they're a calm and collected person like our captain.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We will reach {Kilika} by 42+53.42+54.
Just do 42+55.42+56.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This {S.S. Liki} is under {Yevon2} Temple's
It is being operated under sponsorship.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The weather at sea changes easily, but...
There doesn't seem to be any sign of a storm.
{NEWPAGE}

However, we sometimes encounter something more 42+57.roshii than a storm...
...we sometimes encounter such things, though...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm concerned about the 42+58.item that {Crusader} brought in.
I hope it's not a 42+59.item that goes against the teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This ship, heavily damaged by 『{Sin} 』...
To think it can set sail again...it's a 42+60.miracle.
{NEWPAGE}

However, among the crew members...
There are also those who bear 42+61.wounds in their hearts.
--------------------------------------------------End--

May this pure sea heal the wounds of the men of the sea...
...I hope it will heal them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This ship is being operated under the temple's sponsorship.
If the temple falls into chaos, it will be bad.
{NEWPAGE}

Even so, to think the temple would be 42+62.d so much...
Is this also the times...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

No, this ship has withstood '{Sin}'.
We'll ride out something like the 42+63. waves of the times.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple can no longer be relied upon.
We intend to continue our journey by our 42+64.selves.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We cannot lose to the flying ship people.
That's what you call a sailor's pride.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
Discovered {Jecht}'s sphere!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
Have a look at {CHOICE:30}.
Do not look at {CHOICE:31}.
