Hiccup! I've been watching over Master {Seymour}...
...since he was a boy.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If it's about Master {Seymour}...
...feel free to ask anything!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}{Seymour}'s Ressho Period?
{CHOICE:31}{Seymour}'s Boyhood?
{CHOICE:32}{Seymour}'s Monastic Official Period?
{CHOICE:33}{Seymour}'s Summoner Period?
{CHOICE:34}, I don't want to hear it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Seymour} has the blood of {Guado} and human,
...two races.
{NEWPAGE}

As a result, during his Ressho period...
...he suffered various hardships, it seems.
{NEWPAGE}

However, because of those painful experiences...
...precisely because of those...
{NEWPAGE}

He put in 42+53.effort to bridge the natures of {Guado} and humans,
...and became an admirable person.
--------------------------------------------------End--

About Master {Seymour}...
...you want to know more, don't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--

When Master {Seymour} was about your 42+55.
"{{Sin}}" was defeated by Lord {Braska}.
{NEWPAGE}

{Maester Mika2} wished for the coming of peace.
Lord {Jyscal} was made the master of {{Yevon2}}.
{NEWPAGE}

Of Lord {Jyscal}, who spread teachings to {Guado2}.
In praise of their achievements... that's how it is.
{NEWPAGE}

Lord {Seymour} was still a boy, but...
was assisting Lord {Jyscal}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

After becoming a monastic official, Lord {Seymour}...
rapidly distinguished himself.
{NEWPAGE}

Achieving numerous accomplishments that everyone acknowledged,
he rapidly rose through the ranks.
{NEWPAGE}

Indeed, not through Lord {Jyscal}'s influence.
He earned his position by his own merit.
{NEWPAGE}

Truly, he is a dependable person.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord {Seymour} as a Summoner...
possesses unparalleled abilities.
{NEWPAGE}

However, Lord {Seymour}, to fight "{{Sin}}",
did not embark on a journey, but became the master of {Yevon2}.
{NEWPAGE}

A Summoner's mission is to aim for the defeat of '{{Sin}}'.
is not only that... that is likely his thought.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's no need to hold back, is there?
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Seymour} disappeared,
{Mika}-sama passed away...
{NEWPAGE}

We lost our heart's 42+65.e
all at once.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A monk official who guides the people, in such a state,
this won't do... Ah, how pathetic.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To think that *that* {Seymour} would 42+66.... Ah...
Hmm, congratulations! Truly congratulations!
--------------------------------------------------End--

It is your 42+58.42+67. 42+68..
Please accept it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When {Seymour} was a newly appointed 42+69. monk official,
He was my 42+70. junior.
{NEWPAGE}

And yet, now he is a Master-sama and
even getting the Summoner's 42+71.-san...
{NEWPAGE}

Compared to myself, a humble monk official,
I cannot be a 42+72.42+73., can I?
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Seymour} remains approachable even after becoming important.
He is a fine man who doesn't make his status a 42+74..
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Seymour} did something unforgivable, but
I can't bring myself to 42+75. him.
{NEWPAGE}

I've struggled between humans and {Guado2}.
Because I know him from before...
--------------------------------------------------End--

If he hadn't 42+76. from the path, {Seymour}...
I believe he would have become a respectable master.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord {Seymour} always...
It always gives off a 42+77. 42+78.!
{NEWPAGE}

It's wonderful, isn't it!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Before, people from {Guado} used to come often, but...
Everyone is gone.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even with {Guado2}'s departure...
I'm lonely because I can't meet them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hmm, did I hear some sad 42+79.?
{NEWPAGE}

Even given it's the 42+80. of Lord {Seymour}'s go 42+66....
You shouldn't get too carried away, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's a 42+68. that was 42+81. at 42+80., but...
Don't worry about it; just keep it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people from {Guado2} have lost their motivation,
Apparently they aren't coming out from {Guadosalam}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I also feel like secluding myself in the temple all the time.
I can't believe anything anymore.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Today is a happy {42+58} day!
Even the Reverend is too foolish!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone, please enjoy yourselves!
I'll be happy too!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well now, even though it's rude...
Is {42+84}-sama perhaps a little too excessive?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even the Reverend, who lives by the teachings...
At heart, is he a {42+86} person?
--------------------------------------------------End--

My cousin is outside.
I especially don't want to lose to him.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Unlike him, I'm serious.
I'll only sleep a little bit!
--------------------------------------------------End--
