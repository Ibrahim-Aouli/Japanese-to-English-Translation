The monk woman isn't here anymore.
In the end, I couldn't even say a single proper word.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I invited the monk woman to the cafe, but...
She called me "Impudent!" and rejected me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Master Seymour isn't an ordinary...
...apparently not a Guado.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This year for sure, the Al Bhed Psyches will...
...I believe they'll win the championship!
--------------------------------------------------End--

He seemed fine during the tournament, but...
Even Grand Maester Mika couldn't overcome destiny.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Maester Kinoc prioritized the safety of his people...
...and yet... we lost such a valuable person.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Quitting the Crusaders to become a Blitzball player...
...there are quite a lot of people aiming to become Blitzball players, I hear.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If something were to happen to Grand Maester Mika...
...all the staff would have been fired.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The opening ceremony is starting soon!
Players, wait in the waiting room.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Where have those Crusaders been hiding until now?
I hardly saw them right after the operation, and yet...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Luca Goers was at Port 3.
As expected from a strong team, they had resilience.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Kilika Beasts couldn't advance to the finals, huh...
Well, there's always next year.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm cheering for them, so the winner is...
...unmistakably the Kilika Beasts!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well now, it's going to get exciting!
When the Calm season comes, it'll be a big sale!
--------------------------------------------------End--

If the temples aren't reliable...
...we can't make sales with peace of mind.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm thinking of new merchandise for the monk soldiers.
I wonder what they want.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Extermination Squads departing for missions are buying weapons and items...
...stocking up. I have to replenish the inventory.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Tournament season is the time to make money.
I can't waste a single moment!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Al Bhed who lost their homes...
...are living in the travel agency in the Foreign Quarter.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm an ally of the Extermination Squad and the Al Bhed.
Even the stadium uses machines, after all.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Usually, there's a party after the tournament, but
There was also monster {42+60} activity, so it's cancelled this year...
--------------------------------------------------End--

A walk, when the opening ceremony is so soon?
You're quite {42+61}bold, aren't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--

To defeat 'Shin' with a song...
The person who thought of that strategy is a {42+62}genius!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder what happened to the {42+63} {42+64} ceremony?
There's been no announcement from the temple at all.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Rather than being protected by the warrior monks,
I feel like we're being {42+65}{42+66}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The man in the {42+67} coat cut down a monster with a large sword.
He was so cool~
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hmm, the man in the {42+67} coat, huh...
I feel like I've seen him, and yet haven't...
--------------------------------------------------End--

When Nagi{42+56} arrives, a commemorative Blitz tournament...
They say they'll hold it. You should participate too!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks left 突42+68.Luca.
Not saying anything at all, they're making fools of the people.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks seem stronger than the extermination squad.
I wish they would always {42+69}guard us from now on.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Dealing with the aftermath of the monster 42+60.activity looks tough.
I'll have to repair the stadium all night again...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because I've been staying up all night repeatedly for the tournament preparations.
My physical and mental strength are both at their limit.
--------------------------------------------------End--

42+70.! The extermination team is completely revived! Those guys...
Thanks to them, even I'm feeling energized.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Very few extermination force members returned alive.
It's said to be the greatest defeat since the extermination force was founded...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The extermination force is departing rapidly.
I hope they can return alive...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Auron? I know, I know him!
He's High Summoner Braska's guard, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--

At first, singing with everyone was embarrassing, but...
Once I started singing, I didn't mind it anymore.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't understand difficult things, but...
Lately, the temples are definitely strange.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They lost because only the extermination force and Al Bhed fought.
They should have 42+71.cooperated with the Ronso, warrior monks, and Guado.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If it's Maester Seymour's aeon...
They might be able to defeat "Sin."
--------------------------------------------------End--

There are tons of 42+67.い42+72. people.
I can't remember each one.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Welcome!
--------------------------------------------------End--

In addition to official {blitzball} merchandise,
We also stock rare items!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}, show me your weapons.
{CHOICE:31}, show me your items.
{CHOICE:32} I'll pass.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please come again!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Honestly, I don't believe we can defeat 'Shin' with a song of prayer,
but now that it's come to this, we have no choice but to sing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The extermination squad's equipment is mismatched.
Compared to the warrior monks, it looks inferior 42+73., doesn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

A temple warship is entering Port 3.
Reliable warrior monks will defend Luca 42+74. for us.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Apparently, {Crusader} uses machines in their strategy.
Then that's the same as {Al Bhed}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm so worried that the monsters that appeared in the stadium
haven't snuck into the city 42+75. as well...
--------------------------------------------------End--

To be so afraid 42+76. with just one mad ship...
Children 42+77. are innocent and good.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thanks to that child, the {Sin}'s...
Even the fear 42+78. can be forgotten for a while.

42+81. is partial to the monk soldiers.
I... cannot grow to like 42+58.them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because the extermination team recklessly intervened,
What should we do if 'Sin' gets angry?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Most of the {Crusader} who were protecting the town
...have departed for the operation.
{NEWPAGE}

The current {Luca} is defenseless. If monsters...
...appear, what should we do?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I believed this town alone would not be 42+82.wered by monsters.
And yet...
--------------------------------------------------End--

My child, so much...
...is frolicking...
{NEWPAGE}

It might be a bother, but...
Please be lenient with them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Maester Mika2} has come too.
It will become a tournament remembered in [42+83.42+84.], won't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Will 'Shin' really be gone?
Don't deceive me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's a flying ship in the port!
That's a bad machine, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The extermination squad... I feel sorry for them...
Everyone is downhearted.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The extermination squad violates the teachings.
They say they're bad people.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Mom and Dad aren't well either.
Hey, why, why?
--------------------------------------------------End--

A red balloon.
It's nice, right? It's nice, right!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people are overjoyed by the flying ship's [42+85.].
At a time like this, we must not be careless and [42+69.42+86.].
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ruka is an open city. Precisely because it's open...
We don't know where monsters might enter from.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ruka's men aren't my type.
I prefer a 42+87.strong and masculine42+88. person.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We'll be closed for a while.
The 42+89.chief was bitten by a monster and got injured.
{NEWPAGE}

He made me do 42+90.guard duty, and went to the match by himself...
...he got what he deserved for going to watch the match by himself, didn't he?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wouldn't care if I were 42+82.attacked by a monster...
...I still wanted to watch the match live!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because the 42+89.chief said he was going to watch the match...
...I was forced to do 42+90.guard duty!
{NEWPAGE}

Cut it out! Even I...
...want to go 42+53.cheer for the Goers!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You, instead of me...
...go 42+53.cheer for the Goers for me~!
--------------------------------------------------End--

There are times when the temple makes a 42+54.mistake, but...
...the monk officials are human too, so it can't be helped.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The crowd who came for the tournament 42+91.42+92. returned home...
...Ruka has become a little quieter, hasn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

When a monster appeared in the stadium.
At first, I thought it was a 42+93.show.
{NEWPAGE}

So, when I was nonchalantly watching...
It came to 42+82.attack me, so I was startled.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I like festival 42+60.commotions, but...
I never want that kind of 42+60.commotion again.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The cafe is full, they say.
This is unbearable.
--------------------------------------------------End--

During the tournament, every 42+89.street is greatly 42+95.crowded.
Even getting a meal is a 42+96.struggle.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temples these days aren't very lively, are they!
Even though the people are relying on them, they're irresponsible.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The kids in the subjugation squad are pitiful.
Even though everyone fought earnestly...
--------------------------------------------------End--

It turned into a dreadful 42+60.commotion.
I don't understand it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That's the child who was on the 42+97.broadcast a while ago, isn't it?
Good luck with the match too.
{NEWPAGE}

But even so, for {Aurochs}...
I think a store victory is impossible, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A child who makes {Yevon2}'s teachings `小42+98.42+99.`
They'll end up being excommunicated, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My prayer song, to my brother in another world.
I wonder if he heard it too...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't want to return to Guadosalam.
Because I'll end up remembering my brother...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord {Seymour}... why with a human woman...
Even though I am right here... Fununu.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My brother is really strong.
He is relied upon by Lord {Seymour} as well.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The one who protected {Maester Mika2}...
...was Lord {Seymour}, wasn't it?
{NEWPAGE}

And my brother...
...is protecting Lord {Seymour}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

My brother said that if it's for Lord {Seymour}...
...he would do anything.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, hey! Did you see Lord {Seymour}?
Isn't he great? Isn't he wonderful!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because Lord {Seymour} is watching, {Guado}'s...
...team is fired up too~
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
It's quite crowded.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
{Luca} is the second largest city in {Spira}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Everywhere is like {Besaid} or {Kilika}...
I thought it would be something like that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
The cities... they don't grow big.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
People gather.
When the city gets lively...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
『{Sin} 』？
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Is it safe here?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
It's the same here too.
But there's a stadium, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
So the people of {Crusader}...
risk their lives to drive away '{Sin}'.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
For the stadium?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
If Blitz matches can't be held...
because the fun would be gone.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
In {Spira}, fun things...
there aren't many.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Gah!?
The players are 42+100.42+101. important.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
That's right~
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Is {Zanarkand} like this too?
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
It's much more cluttered than here.
It's packed with huge 42+102.things.
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
It must be amazing...
I might get dizzy.
--------------------------------------------------End--

--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Let's look for {Auron}!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
What were you doing?!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Huh?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
{Yuna} was kidnapped.
{Al Bhed Psyches}'s doing.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
If you want her to return unharmed...
...lose in the first round, they said.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
How despicable...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
If that 42+104.person were just a player...
I don't think they'd do something so underhanded, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
There's also a chance, just in case.
I'm going to rescue her!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
I'm going too!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
It's fine, I said!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
To a team on a 23-game losing streak...
To tell us to lose on purpose...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
A team that says things like that...
They're not much.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
{Wakka} and the others said that too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
I'll manage the match, so...
...please take care of {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
A {Al Bhed} clan ship is...
...entering port at __P0__ [Port 4] in __P1__.

Are you really departing?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Reti!
You should rest well.

{Wakka} 
{Yuna}'s journey must press on.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
There's no way we can rest...
...we can't.
--------------------------------------------------End--

But...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Hey!
Straighten up, all of you!

...just begun!

{Wakka} 
What are those glum faces?!

{Wakka} 
See ya.
Stay well.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Take care.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Aurochs} Everyone:
Right...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Your voice is too quiet!
