Did you rest well?

The others left a little while ago.

Ah, wait!
--------------------------------------------------End--

To the Save Sphere,
It would be better to record.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Are you still in line?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Mister Mise has already left.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ah, I'm still cleaning.
{NEWPAGE}

Anyway, isn't it time to depart?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ah, I'm still cleaning.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if it gets like this, this place is my Kyoou.
It's too late now, I have no intention of moving elsewhere.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if the town's repairs advance,
People's hearts don't work that way, you know.
{NEWPAGE}

42+53. The weak ones, one after another,
abandon the island and leave.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I won't abandon Kyoou!
I won't move for anything.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people of {Kilika} are accustomed to ruin.
I won't struggle now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I, in this {Kilika},
just want to 42+54.live peacefully.
{NEWPAGE}

Other than that, I don't wish for anything else.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I grow up,
I'm going to be a Blitzball player!
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I grow up,
I'm going to ride an airship!
