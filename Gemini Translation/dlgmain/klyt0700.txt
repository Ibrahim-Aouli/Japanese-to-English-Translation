To become a respectable priest official...
...you have to study a lot, I heard.
{NEWPAGE}

Ugh...
I want to go play by the sea.

Breaking the rules, into the Chamber of Trials...
...I've tried entering it before.
{NEWPAGE}

By the priest official, very, very much...
...I got scolded.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Subjugation Squad members, what's wrong?
Everyone is crestfallen.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You sing when you see a ship, right?
I know that much!
--------------------------------------------------End--

We sang together because we saw a ship!
I was the best!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I love studying teachings!
{NEWPAGE}

When you study a lot...
...the priest official gives us snacks.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My father and mother...
...went to a place called 'Ikai'.
{NEWPAGE}

I wonder when they'll come back?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because the Cleric wasn't energetic.
I sang for them.
{NEWPAGE}

Hehehe...
I got praised.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Clerics are restless.
I wonder what's wrong.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We all sang together, but...
Still can't defeat '{Sin}'?
--------------------------------------------------End--
