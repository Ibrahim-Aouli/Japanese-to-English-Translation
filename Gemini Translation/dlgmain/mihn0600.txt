{Dona} 
Please don't make me say it repeatedly.
I am a Summoner!
--------------------------------------------------End--

But I have no business here!
Please understand!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
To interrupt a Summoner's journey...
What are you thinking?
--------------------------------------------------End--

But I have no business here!
There is no passing!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
This is pointless!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sorry, but the road is closed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I said the road is closed!
I know it's confusing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

42+53.Help me out!
Because we're going to defeat 『{Sin} 』!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
Oh, you all...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
As you can see, it's a roadblock even for a Summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
Even though you'll end up relying on a Summoner eventually.
You don't understand at all.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
Well, since it's a good opportunity,
I'll go back and rest.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
Let's go, {Barthello}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

At the Mushroom Rock Road ahead!
The operation by {Crusader} will commence!
--------------------------------------------------End--

My deepest apologies, but!
No one can pass through~!
--------------------------------------------------End--

From the {Operation Mi'ihen} Operation Executive Committee,
We are requesting your donations and cooperation.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We are truly deeply grateful for your cooperation.
Please accept this!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thank you for your cooperation.
Please, take this!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thanks.
Please use this.

{Lucil} 
Deployment of rear support units, and...
Cavalry drills completed.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
Evacuation guidance for civilians in the vicinity is also proceeding smoothly!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
Only a few remain, but...
The evacuation will be completed shortly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hmm, well done.
Are there any problems?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
No! Absolutely no problem!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Alright, understood.
I acknowledge preparations for the operation are complete.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Chocobo Cavalry, promptly take up your positions.
Prepare for the operation to begin!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
Understood!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
Understood!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're the Summoner and her guards, right?
My apologies for the trouble.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I appreciate {42+53.strength}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What? You didn't know...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The '{{sinspawn}}' that was {42+63.captured} in {42+62.place}
Are successively being brought here.
--------------------------------------------------End--

At locations where '{{sinspawn}}' are present,
A '{{Sin}}' will appear, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--

By utilizing this characteristic,
We will lure out '{{Sin}}'.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This operation: [{{Operation Mi'ihen}}]
Its greatest feature lies in the {42+64.battle} with {{Al Bhed}} people.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We, the subjugation unit, will lure out '{{Sin}}'
The {Al Bhed} people deliver the finishing blow.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The desire to defeat '{Sin}'.
Because we are no different from the {Al Bhed} people.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They resurrected...
...the ancient machines.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Those machines are as powerful as summoned beasts...
...I hear they produce power.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Their machines, of course...
...go against {Yevon2}'s teachings, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ah... I'll stop there.
It's better not to know about things that go against the teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Crusader} participating in this operation...
...were all excommunicated from the temple.
--------------------------------------------------End--

As for my family...
...they won't even speak to me anymore.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We will defeat '{Sin}' with this operation.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If we don't, our place to belong...
...will vanish completely.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
It's {Gatta} and {Luzzu} from {Besaid}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
This is the last decoy.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You've come a long way.
Now, please come through.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Blitz, please teach me about this formation, okay!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
I'll just go and...
...defeat 『__P0__ 』 and return, so wait for me.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
We were supposed to gather here, but...
Captain {Lucil} and the others aren't coming...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
That {Elma}...
I wonder what they're doing...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
The place we can go by Chocobo is...
...up to here!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
Alright, alright, get off!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymour} 
We meet again, {Yuna} 42+66..
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Y-Yes!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymour} 
What's wrong?
You seem tired, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Actually...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymour} 
I see.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I was waiting for you.
I will guide you to Operations Command!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymour} 
Before that, I have a request.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hah! Anything!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymour} 
Summoner {Yuna} 42+66. and the guards too,
I would like them to pass through as well.
--------------------------------------------------End--

With all due respect, {Seymour}-sama...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymour} 
I will not cause trouble for you.
I will take all responsibility.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Understood.
Passage is permitted.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymour} 
Now, go ahead.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Oh... thank you very much.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
{Yuna}, let's go.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Yeah!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
That arrogant person.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
It's not arrogance.
He's truly important.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hello there!
This time it's free.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This time it's free, but...
It seems you're already riding~
{NEWPAGE}

I'll make it free for you next time.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Would you like to ride a Chocobo~?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please take care on your journey.
--------------------------------------------------End--

How to ride a Chocobo...
Would you like to know?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm delivering meals
to the soldiers!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The operation will begin soon.
Those not involved are not allowed to pass.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Good children will be eaten by 『{Sin}』.
My mom said that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The operation will begin soon.
Those not involved are not allowed to pass.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even we are {Crusader}!
We're doing our work properly too!
{NEWPAGE}

My role is...
It's tidying up everyone's belongings!
--------------------------------------------------End--

How about that? It's amazing work, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

If it passes, what will happen?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hyaa...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even a great Master is here.
I must do my best!
--------------------------------------------------End--

By {Maester Kinoc}'s command.
The highway is under guard!
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Al Bhed}'s lot has come all the way here...
They're here to make money.
{NEWPAGE}

After driving the plan to failure...
What an impudent lot!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Eventually, our warrior monk army...
We will repel {Al Bhed2}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The large items around here...
They're all {Crusader}'s parting gifts.
{NEWPAGE}

Those guys, with only the clothes on their backs.
It ran away.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Into such a cage, {sinspawn}...
They had put it in...? They're wasting it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
Shall I go find {CHOICE:30}?
{CHOICE:31}, we mustn't disturb them, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Few are guarding beyond this point.
Monsters are rampant, so be careful.
--------------------------------------------------End--

And deploy soldiers even at {Mushroom Rock Road}...
I want to ensure the safety of the main road, but...
{NEWPAGE}

Anyway, we're short on manpower.
Please understand.

{CHOICE:32}, I'll go for 10,000 Gil!!
{CHOICE:33}, I don't want to contribute.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You don't have enough Gil.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Our guarding method is difficult, so we...
We are struggling in that cage.
{NEWPAGE}

It's good we didn't have to clean up after the operation.
It's a lucky accident, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sometimes, the travel company's {Al Bhed2}...
They bring refreshments.
{NEWPAGE}

I don't really understand their way of thinking, but...
Anyone who gives us food is a friend.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please come through.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks guarding this place, and {Guado2}...
They've gone somewhere.
{NEWPAGE}

Could it be... the rebels...
...are they pursuing them?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The ones who truly protect the people are...
Only {Crusader}...
--------------------------------------------------End--

When the machine ship flew, of course I sang.
That child from {Al Bhed} was with me too.
{NEWPAGE}

Even though our words didn't connect, to be able to sing the same song...
It was somehow strange.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people of {Yevon2} and {Al Bhed2}...
...perhaps there's a way for them to get along.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{CHOICE:30}, don't worry about it.
I want to hear about the {CHOICE:31} operation.
