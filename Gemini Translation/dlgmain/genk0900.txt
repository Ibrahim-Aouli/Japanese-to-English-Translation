{Tidus} 
The town is sinking!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
It's a mechanical town from over 1000 years ago.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
They built many bridges over the river,
and apparently built a town on top of them.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
The bridges collapsed due to the town's weight,
and it sank to the bottom of the river, I hear.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Well, that's a good lesson.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
A lesson?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Why were you silent!?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Building a town over a river...
What's the point?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Hmm... there's a lot of water, so...
it's beneficial, or something.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Nope, that's not it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
It's just that their technology...
they just wanted to test their power.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Is that so?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
It's {Yevon2}'s teaching.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
When people gain power,
they can't help but use it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
I have to forbid it.
So it's endless.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
{Yuna} I'll save you now!
--------------------------------------------------End--
