--------------------------------------------------End--

The Temples and the Al Bhed are teaming up with a flying ship...
Is the rumor that they're fighting Sin true?
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's good the operation force has regained its spirit, but...
I'm worried they're about to start another reckless operation.
--------------------------------------------------End--

During the operation, I heard cannon fire all the way in Luca.
It seems it was an intense battle...
--------------------------------------------------End--

We're not warrior monks anymore.
We got fired, rather than quit, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This shop is such a struggle, I want to sell it off quickly
I want to find a new job in Luca.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If I could ride on that flying ship, Luca and...
Kilika's {42+53.復} would be easier, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The ferry has started moving, so...
I can finally return to Kilika!
--------------------------------------------------End--

To the Summoner, as soon as possible...
I wish they'd do something.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sin hasn't appeared recently.
Instead, I'm getting worried...
--------------------------------------------------End--

As expected, the operation force couldn't win.
I thought it would turn out this way from the beginning.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Crusader} says they'll defeat 『{Sin} 』.
They're boasting, but I can't expect much.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If Nagi42+54. comes, immediately...
Apparently, there'll be a commemorative Blitz tournament!
{NEWPAGE}

If you secure tickets now,
it looks like you could make a huge profit!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Brother, were you a player?
Do your best during the commemorative tournament!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if various incidents occur,
Luca city revolves around Blitz.
{NEWPAGE}

Even if the Yevon Temple is tottering,
this city remains unchanged.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if 『Sin』 comes, the matter of tomorrow's match...
we won't forget... that's what it means to be the people of Luca.
--------------------------------------------------End--

As for those monk soldiers, their own exclusive seats...
they're apparently blabbering, "Prepare them!"
{NEWPAGE}

They're outrageous!
Who do they think they are?!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Those monk soldiers who are getting carried away...
will surely face retribution!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Monster 42+55.Moving? What about it?
It's no big deal.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone will quickly forget it.
They'll become engrossed in Blitz.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm eagerly looking forward to the next tournament.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The opening ceremony has started.
Everyone went to go watch it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I mean, you're a player, right?
Is it okay to be wandering around?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The young woman who was with you just now...
Where did she go?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Aha... you got rejected, huh...
Don't mope, live strongly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey mister, do you have a ticket?
If you have 42+56.one, I'll buy it from you~
--------------------------------------------------End--

Or do you want better seats?
How about pair seats with that young woman?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Huh? Mister, you're a player...
Then you have no use for tickets.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't really buy tickets~
We have front row {42+57} seats~
--------------------------------------------------End--

From in front of the stadium.
We are {42+59} delivering by live {42+58} broadcast.
--------------------------------------------------End--

With the opening ceremony {42+60} approaching soon,
The excitement is building... hey, wait!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm in the middle of a {42+61} report.
Don't interrupt!

Until now, we have regarded machines and the Al Bhed...
...with hatred, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Now, a forbidden machine, the airship,
is cornering 'Sin'.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Regarding Yevon's teachings, which have lasted 1000 years,
it might be time to reconsider them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Furthermore, since Grand Maester Mika's death, Yevon Temple...
...has remained silent... Ugh!
--------------------------------------------------End--

This is important news for Spira!
Don't interrupt! Don't interrupt!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Currently, Yevon Temple is in great {42+63} disarray, but
there have been no specific announcements.
--------------------------------------------------End--

the Temple's {42+64} stance, which seems to ignore the people.
Voices of criticism are growing louder.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even people disappointed with the Temple are leaving Bevelle.
are increasing... Hey, hey, hey!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Stop interfering with my work, I told you!
You're really an attention-seeker, aren't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--

As you know, the Mi'ihen Session...
...ended in a complete failure.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Replacing the annihilated expeditionary force, monk warriors and...
...the Guado tribe are handling preparations for the position.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This is Maester Kinoc and Maester Seymour's...
...decision... H-Hey, wait!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Stop interrupting!
As always, you're an attention-seeker, aren't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--

About the fiend in the stadium...
...do you know anything?
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's too little information...
...so it can't become news.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What? Do you want me to report on it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Aurochs} will, this year too,
be eliminated in the first round anyway, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Something where the outcome is already clear...
...even if you {42+61.} it...
--------------------------------------------------End--

All of Spira is {42+69.} holding its breath watching the flying ship's
battle... Hey, move aside, move aside!
--------------------------------------------------End--

This is unofficial information, but Master Seymour has committed a {42+70.} terrible crime...
...Hey, hey, you're getting in the way of work!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The connection between the Summoner Disappearance Incident and the Al Bhed tribe...
...Ugh, just let me work!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even though I {42+61.} quite a lot, no one...
...has any decent information.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you win at least once,
I might even {42+61.} for you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh, right! Congratulations on your {42+71.} victory!
I've started to see {Aurochs} in a new light.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Did our song of prayer reach the flying ship?
...I wonder.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temples are in chaos, but precisely at times like this,
we should believe in the teachings and await the Nagi{42+54.}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I pray from my heart that the casualties of the extermination force may rest peacefully...
...in the Farplane.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Master Seymor}'s summoned beast...
It was a tremendous power.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To be recognized by the master at that young age...
It's no wonder.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Are you a Summoner?
No, I haven't seen them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if they came through here, in the crowd...
They would have blended in and I wouldn't have known.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Speaking of which, the sound of a finger whistle...
...I thought I heard...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Honestly, things like winning or losing the match...
...they don't matter to me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I just want to get excited about the match and revel.
...that's all I want to do.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Calm coming in my lifetime...
...I hadn't even imagined it would come.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Recently, the entire town of Guadosalam...
...is in a dark, gloomy mood, like the Farplane, I hear.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if the Crusaders are defeated, the monk soldiers...
...because they will protect us, we're safe, aren't we?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ahead is {Blue} [Luca Theater]{White}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

For a memory of your journey.
42+76. Please enjoy the statues and music.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple isn't doing anything, I bet...
...because they're thinking of an amazing strategy.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because the warrior monks will protect us.
Even if fiends appear, it'll be fine.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That fiend, '{Sin},' is coming.
I hope it's not a precursor...
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I think about the tournament starting soon...
There's no way I can stay calm.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people of Kilika must have sung too.
I believe so.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Kilika again, by '__P0__'...
42+77. I'm worried it will be destroyed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Kilika Beasts returned to the island.
Next year, I really hope they 42+71.win.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This year's {Kilika Beasts}...
They weren't very 42+78.active.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, the island was attacked by '{Sin}'.
It's just that, so it's no wonder.
--------------------------------------------------End--

In my family, since my great-grandfather's generation.
I'm 42+64.supporting {Kilika Beasts}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To the flying ships, Yevon's 42+79.grace...
Let us pray that it is bestowed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Some of Luca's people disregard the teachings.
They are doing so. It is foolish.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I will stay in Luca for a while, and to the 42+80.people,
I intend to preach Yevon's teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thanks to {Master Seymor}'s summoned beast,
the 42+81.42+82. was kept to a minimum.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This truly is {Yevon2}'s gift;
it is nothing else.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people are 42+83. letting loose
and 42+55.reveling, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Formal preaching,
let us avoid.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Build many flying ships,
and we just need to concentrate our attack on 'Sin'.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I saw the flying ship at Port One.
With that, can we fight 'Sin'?
--------------------------------------------------End--

That was a shame about the extermination squad...
I thought it would go well, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Of all places, in front of the Grand Maester...
For monsters to rampage...
--------------------------------------------------End--

For {Spira}, a safe place...
...doesn't exist anywhere, does it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Haven't you seen my child?
I lost them in the crowd.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I told them to signal with finger 42+74. if they got separated...
Even though I told them to...
--------------------------------------------------End--

When Nagi 42+54. comes, even the temple...
...will surely regain its vitality.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Macalania Temple has lost its vitality.
I can't bring myself to 42+84. in a place like that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Having broken the teachings and then suffered a crushing defeat...
...the extermination squad should be disbanded.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Crusader} is devising an ill-advised plan, I hear.
(Combined with 18)
--------------------------------------------------End--

Something about 42+85.ing forces with people.
Not doing it...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Would a cleric's [42+86.] be too [42+66.] noticeable?
I wonder if I should change into [42+86.] and [42+87.]bō.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if we weaken 'Sin' with machines and songs of prayer.
Only the Summoner can deliver the finishing blow.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks can't be relied on.
In the end, it didn't [42+66.]ta for any [42+88.] at all.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Aren't the [42+89.] people of the monster [42+55.] movement Al Bhed?
Bad things are always their fault.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Up until [42+90.] year, the tournament's [42+68.]bi...
It was {Crusader}'s shio.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If {Crusader} had been doing it this year too.
Monsters wouldn't have appeared.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Al Bhed2} in the Ebon Cup...
I don't like the idea of them appearing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Flying ships are forbidden machines, but...
We just need to ask the temple for permission.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks came right away when the extermination team lost.
I wonder if they knew the plan would fail.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The [42+91.]s were seriously injured by monsters.
This is no joke...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I feel sorry for the people from {Crusader}, too.
They're preparing their strategy without even watching the tournament, I hear.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Warrior monks apparently swarmed Besaid Island.
They went to capture the rebels, I hear.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Auraka has been reborn, hasn't it?
I'm looking forward to your swift advance!
--------------------------------------------------End--

This is the first time in my life...
I saw {Aurochs} win.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're {Aurochs}'s helper, aren't you?
D-d-do your best!
--------------------------------------------------End--

They say it's no use for the people to struggle.
We should just pray for Nagi42+54. to come.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Without relying on the power of machines, just leave it to the Summoner-sama.
It'll be fine if we leave everything to them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This year, {Aurochs} made great progress, but...
it was overshadowed because of the monster activity, wasn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

A Summoner-sama was just around here a while ago...
They came, right? What kind of person were they?
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're, if I remember correctly, a rebel...!?
--------------------------------------------------End--

You should stop.
We're no match.
--------------------------------------------------End--

But then, as warrior monks,
our 42+66. place...
--------------------------------------------------End--

What are you saying? We missed the ship to Bevelle.
We're already dropouts.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Certainly, even if I fought you,
I don't think I could win...
--------------------------------------------------End--

We're dressed as warrior monks, but
we're practically 42+92. fired.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The monster that appeared in the stadium,
what on earth was it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

It seems they don't understand at all.
They say it seemed to just spring out of nowhere.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This year, I'm putting my support
into __P0__.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're still so 42+93. biased.
You're 42+64. supporting {Al Bhed2}?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The way they all hide their 42+94. identities
is mysterious and makes me curious.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If {Seymour} hadn't saved us,
What would have become of us...
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Master Seymor} is our lifesaver.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My favorite is {Ronso Fangs}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Ronso2} 〜？
You like someone that bulky?
--------------------------------------------------End--

They're not bulky, they're sturdy!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The monsters were surprising, but
There was something even more surprising.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Aurochs}'s 42+71.victory, right?
I still can't believe it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Huh? {Besaid Aurochs}?
--------------------------------------------------End--

That place is... you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, hey, let's skip 42+68.preparations
and go have some 42+87.fun somewhere?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Wh-What are you saying?!
We are 42+96.honorable Yevon warrior monks!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Tsk! You're such a stick-in-the-mud! Monks...
They're too serious, it's annoying.
--------------------------------------------------End--

And you're a monk yourself...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Now that we've come to warm Luca,
Even the warrior monks should be more open.
--------------------------------------------------End--

For {Aurochs} to win...
It's definitely some kind of mistake.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That's right! More than the monster...
We should investigate that instead.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Gowers winning for us...
I'm happy, but I can't honestly rejoice.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because the monster appeared, things became ambiguous...
...and it ended up vague, you see.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder what kind of developments there will be this year?
--------------------------------------------------End--

That's Gowers' victory.
It's already decided, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

That's true! What I want to say is...
It's about how many points Bixun will score.
--------------------------------------------------End--

After all, the one to lead Gowers is...
It can only be Bixun.
--------------------------------------------------End--

But lately, Graab has also been improving.
He might become the star in this tournament.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm devoted to Bixun alone!
Because he's always at the top.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My sister's 42+91. 42+103. is
Grave's cousin!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even I am acquainted with Bixun-sama's 42+104.42+91.'s
later 42+105.!
--------------------------------------------------End--

When Nagi 42+54. comes, I plan to travel throughout Spira and
collect 42+99. voices.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you want me to 42+61.,
bring me a scoop.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Don't bother me! You stood out enough during the tournament,
so isn't that enough?
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Besaid Aurochs} Congratulations on your 42+71. victory!
I've captured it perfectly!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, it's strange to say, but
I never even dreamed of achieving a 42+71. victory.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Keii is in the middle of 42+61. of monster 42+55. activity.
See you later 42+106.!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, {Aurochs}'s naughty 42+107.!
Thanks for the good scoop earlier.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Keep that up and disrupt the tournament
for me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The opening ceremony is soon, right~?
Is it okay to be loitering around?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, is it true the ferry service is suspended?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Still, in the nearby sea, '{Sin}'
might be there, they say.
--------------------------------------------------End--

At this rate, when {Kilika}
can be dealt with, I have no idea.
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Excuse me, please let me through.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Alright, let's go.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
It's so popular~.
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
It would be terrible if we got separated.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
{Yuna} ！
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Woah!?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Wh-What?
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
In {Zanarkand}, during a Blitz,
this is how you provide support.
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
It seems no good.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
It's practice!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
That's right.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
If we get separated, we'll meet up with that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Then I'll immediately
fly over.
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Until {42+109.} we start to lose.
So, it's about not getting separated.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Understood.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Yuna, you try it too.
Place your finger like this...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Um... like this?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Not like that, this way.
--------------------------------------------------End--
