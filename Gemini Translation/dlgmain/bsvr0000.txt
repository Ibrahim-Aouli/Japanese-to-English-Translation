{Wakka} 
Hey, sleepyhead.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
I was thinking of giving it to you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Amazing... Can I have it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Oh, please use it!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
That's what I gave to {Chappu}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Don't worry about it.
He didn't use even one row.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
{Yuna}, go to the shop.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
You're on the same ship as {Yuna}, right?
Wouldn't it be fine to go ahead?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
10 years ago, {Yuna} came to this village.
It was the year Lord {Braska}'s Nagi-degree began.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Nagi-setsu?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
From that time, {Yuna}...
They're like a younger sister to me and {Lulu}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Knowing that Taikyo exists...
And becoming a Sub-Summoner...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
And today...
Departs on a journey as a Summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
From the beginning, together...
So, you want to go on a journey?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Such 42+53.things will only be a hindrance.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Oh, I have nothing.
A gift for the temple that will care for us!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
{Yuna}'s journey isn't like that, is it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I see.
You're right.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Then, let's go!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I came to apprehend you all,
I came from Bevelle, but...
{NEWPAGE}

The more I listened to the villagers' stories, the more I
found it hard to believe the talk that you were rebels.
{NEWPAGE}

But warrior monks are lying in wait inside the temple.
Please turn back before anyone notices.
--------------------------------------------------End--

No!
The warrior monks will capture you!
--------------------------------------------------End--

After all, you weren't rebels or anything like that,
were you? Now, please pass through.
--------------------------------------------------End--

No longer, you all,
will anyone try to capture.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Rebel, {Yuna}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Prepare to charge!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do not approach the Summoner!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard you came from the sea.
I heard it from {Luzzu} and them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

By Lord {High Summoner Gandof}'s power.
Please protect my family...
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's the preparation before going out to 42+54.
Monsters also appear in the sea, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Don't say foolish things.
Are you going to break the 42+55., you spoiled brat?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Together with Dad.
Pray for safety, okay?
--------------------------------------------------End--

You too, won't you pray for Jushou-sama's safety?
(See line 15)
--------------------------------------------------End--

It might be better if your malice doesn't disappear.
(See line 17)
{NEWPAGE}

Painful things and sad things too.
You can remain having forgotten them, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple has its back to the sea.
Shall I tell you the reason 42+57.?
{NEWPAGE}

From the sea, 『{Sin} 』 comes.
I want to look away.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'll be going out to 42+54. soon, so concerning 『{Sin} 』.
I'm praying not to meet them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's the preparation before going out to 42+54.
Monsters also appear in the sea, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This year's {Aurochs} was a fierce struggle.
{Wakka} did well.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I cannot be of help to Lord {Yuna},
I will pray for your safe journey.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if I know that 『{Sin} 』 is in the sea.
If I don't go out to 42+54., I can't make a living.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're rebels, I hear?
Oh dear, what a terrible false accusation.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord {Yuna}'s Nagi level
...who knows when it will be.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple is only chasing rebels, and
『{Sin} 』 is neglected.
{NEWPAGE}

The day we can do 42+54. with peace of mind
seems still far off.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Nagido will appear soon at 42+54.
It seems we'll be 42+59.ing on the ship.
--------------------------------------------------End--

While I was doing 42+54., a flying ship and...
{Sin} flew past.
{NEWPAGE}

I was looking up, forgetting even to sing.
It was an astonishing sight.
--------------------------------------------------End--

On the flying ship, {Yevon2}'s gift...
I'm praying it will be 42+60.d.
--------------------------------------------------End--

An unusual 42+61., isn't it? Where are you from?
It's your first time coming to {Besaid}, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because outsiders don't come very often.
I remember everyone's 42+62. who came.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone went to the temple, but...
I'll decide to pray at home.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just thinking about if something were to happen...
Even going to check on things is scary...
--------------------------------------------------End--

With this, {Yuna}-sama is also a full-fledged...
Summoner-sama, aren't they?
{NEWPAGE}

When you came to {Besaid}...
You were so small...
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Yuna} should be able to become the Great Summoner.
Everyone connected to {Besaid} believes that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It seems {Crusader}'s plan failed.
I wonder if {Luzzu} and their group will return after opposing [42+63?].
--------------------------------------------------End--

I have no intention of defying the teachings, but...
Lately, there's something strange about the temple.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Dad, not at all...
He doesn't play with me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To join the Extermination Squad, or {Aurochs}...
I'm having trouble deciding.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm good at Blitz!
I can even hold my breath for a long time!
--------------------------------------------------End--

To join the Extermination Squad,
I hear you have to train.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The three of us: {Luzzu}, {Gatta}, and me,
will defeat '{Sin}!'
--------------------------------------------------End--

Dad, what should we do?
Let's go help!
--------------------------------------------------End--

But...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yeah!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'll be a good boy, so...
Help Jushō-sama...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Summoner came to the village the other day.
Umm... what was their name again?
--------------------------------------------------End--

My brother's malice.
It seems to have been cured.
--------------------------------------------------End--

P0 and the others haven't returned.
What could have happened to them?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Is it true that P0-sama is a rebel?
Everyone is saying it's a lie.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Letters arrived from everyone in P0.
They're working hard in P0, they say.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Really, will 'P0' very soon...
...disappear, I wonder?
--------------------------------------------------End--

As long as I am well, {Besaid} 42+64.things'
tales 42+65. I will not let be changed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's nothing to worry about. If it's that person, surely...
...they will surely return.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just because it took a little time...
...panicking would be disrespectful.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if 'P0' comes tomorrow.
Today's way of life won't change.
{NEWPAGE}

I'll just continue my work in silence.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't care who the rebel is.
If we defeat 『{Sin} 』, everything will be wiped clean.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't feel at ease until the Nagido truly comes.
I don't want to rejoice prematurely.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Watched over by Lord {Braska}.
Lord Jushou must also be persevering.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's hot, so go into the shade.
You'll collapse.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Last month, we caught a lot, but...
The whole ship was taken out by 『{Sin} 』...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The one who came from the sea...
Is that you?
{NEWPAGE}

You still have some venom in you, don't you?
You should rest properly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To not come back even for a single night...
I'm terribly worried.
--------------------------------------------------End--

With that person, to anything terrible...
I don't think will happen, though...
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's good that the ferry has started moving, but...
I wonder if '{Sin}' won't appear again...
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Crusader} who fought '{Sin},'
apparently had a terrible experience.
{NEWPAGE}

Truly, what a cruel story...
It's because they break the teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When {Crusader}'s children return,
we'll have to scold them thoroughly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The other day, many monk soldiers
came to search for Lord {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If Lord {Yuna} defeats '{Sin},'
the unpleasant rumors should disappear too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

On that flying ship,
I wonder who was on board...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thanks to the flying ship,
the whole village is bustling.
{NEWPAGE}

Everywhere in {Spira}
it might be the same.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Welcome!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
Buy {CHOICE:30} items.
{CHOICE:31} I'll pass.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30} Buy weapons.
{CHOICE:31} Buy items.
{CHOICE:32} I'll pass.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thank you very much.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, Jushou-sama...
Has everyone from __P0__ still not returned?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Accompanying {Yuna}-sama means...
Will you also become a guard?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30} I won't.
{CHOICE:31} Maybe so.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Then you'll focus on the tournament!
Please let {Aurochs} win this year.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If there's anything you don't understand about guarding,
you should ask {Lulu}.
{NEWPAGE}

{Lulu} is strong and very knowledgeable.
{Wakka} is much more reliable than {Wakka}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hope the poison heals soon.
{NEWPAGE}

While praying for {Yuna}-sama's safety,
I'll also pray for you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There are rumors about you.
It's a small village, so news spreads quickly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This year's tournament, too, {Aurochs}...
Will it be a first-round defeat again...?
{NEWPAGE}

At least to a draw...
I hope they can manage that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It'll be alright, I'm sure.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Don't say such things anymore.
...Please.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Jūshō-sama hasn't returned.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30} Jūshō-sama?
{CHOICE:31} "Hasn't returned," you say?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Jūshō-sama is Jūshō-sama.
I mean Jūshō the Summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They haven't returned from the Hall of Trials.
A whole day has passed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please be 42+56. safe...
--------------------------------------------------End--

While Big Sister is praying...
That means I'm on 42+73. duty.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Buy again, okay?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Buy again, okay?
{NEWPAGE}

Ah, that's right!
{NEWPAGE}

42+74. My child picked something up.
What was that, I wonder...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

For {Wakka} to retire...
I think it's a waste.
{NEWPAGE}

With {Wakka} and you, {Aurochs}'s...
I wanted you to 42+76.lead __P1__'s 42+75.golden age.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Finally, because the ferry has resumed operation...
I wonder if customers will increase.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks came to look for {Yuna}.
They said, 'Those who harbor him are also rebels!'
{NEWPAGE}

I can't believe that sort of important people are protecting the temple.
(Combined with 12)
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Aurochs}'s people are still {Luca}, right?
Let out 42+62. for them once in a while.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What happened to the airship battle in the end?
Could it be they were defeated...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

This is just between us, but in the current temple...
I heard there isn't even one master monk.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh, that's right, I'll give you this.
This one brought it in its mouth.
{NEWPAGE}

I don't know what it is, somehow.
Well, just keep it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Big brother, who are you?
Where did you come from?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Juushou-sama is missing.
But they haven't come back...
--------------------------------------------------End--

When {Yuna}-sama comes back,
I want to hear many stories.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Summoner-sama came on a ship.
He was a kind older brother.
{NEWPAGE}

But I like {Yuna}-sama more~!
--------------------------------------------------End--

When it becomes Nagi-do, with {Yuna}-sama,
let's celebrate, okay?
--------------------------------------------------End--

What is a Hangyakusha? Even if I ask Soukan-sama,
they won't tell me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When a ship flies here again,
I must sing with a loud voice!
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's holding something in its mouth...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{Yellow} obtained a sticky, drool-covered {White}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

But monsters are lurking around.
You shouldn't go out alone.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even though they know it's dangerous.
There's no way I can let them through.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord Jūshō, I hope he's safe...
--------------------------------------------------End--

You shouldn't just wander around either.
We must pray for that person's safety.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Luzzu} and the others have departed for the mission.
42+77. is on 42+78. guard duty.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Actually, {Gatta} was supposed to be on 42+78. guard duty.
That person insisted on going with them.
{NEWPAGE}

For a new 42+79., they're so reckless.
Even though it's a mission they might die on...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh, would you like to rest?
That's right, you shouldn't overdo it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30} Take a break.
{CHOICE:31} Maybe next time.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Compared to the monsters we fought in the mission...
{Besaid}'s monsters are practically cute.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even I've accumulated 42+80.42+81.
I'll just defeat the monsters.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder if that flying ship is {Al Bhed}'s machine.
I really want you to do well this time.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Subjugation Squad Lodging is open to all travelers.
Will you rest?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I want to go check on the temple, but...
I also have preparations for the operation...
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Wakka} and the others are waiting outside.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Actually, I was also affected by {Sin}'s toxic influence...
...I was one of those affected.
{NEWPAGE}

I'm much better now, though.
At first, it was terrible.
{NEWPAGE}

Even who I was or where I was from...
...I couldn't remember at all.
{NEWPAGE}

At that time, I felt like crying.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thanks to desperately praying at the temple,
my condition improved greatly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you pray at the temple, even a toxic influence like that will be cured.
I'm telling you, you 間42+82. can't go wrong.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please cure my toxic influence quickly...
An important operation is coming up soon...
--------------------------------------------------End--

As for {Wakka}, they were summoned by the Monk Official and
went to the temple.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I still have some of '{Sin}'s influence...
...because I haven't fully recovered from it yet, so I'm staying behind.
{NEWPAGE}

It's frustrating to be left out like this, but
I'm a little relieved.
{NEWPAGE}

This operation is dangerous, after all...
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you pray at the temple, even a toxic influence like that will be cured.
I'm telling you, you 間42+82. can't go wrong.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm praying for {Luzzu} and the others' safety.
It's a dangerous operation, after all.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Crusader} was excommunicated, so truthfully,
they shouldn't really enter the temple, but...
{NEWPAGE}

The Monk Official specially permitted it.
They're not just a strict person.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Nothing but empty beds, with no one in them.
It's gotten quite lonely...
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Operation Mi'ihen}... it didn't work out.
I thought we would surely win!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone, please...
Come back safe and sound...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Prayer cannot defeat monsters.
It's {Crusader} who protects {Besaid}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The poison has finally subsided. Until now...
Having rested, I need to properly [42+85.].
--------------------------------------------------End--

The battle with '{Sin}' is still ongoing, right?
Can't we do something as well...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm repairing the rain leak.
Don't bother me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's fine to be [42+86.] for free, but...
It's falling apart everywhere, isn't it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Besaid} Village, many rows...
Is being [42+87.] by '{Sin}'.
{NEWPAGE}

This house, too, seems to have been left neglected since it was hit at that time.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We'll be defeated by '{Sin}' eventually anyway.
Sometimes [42+85.] feels pointless.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They don't look robust, and besides...
Their body might not hold up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

By the time {Crusader}'s group returns...
I guess I'll get this rain leak fixed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Crusader} is eager, but those guys...
I don't think we can do anything about 『{Sin}』.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Luzzu} and {Gatta} haven't returned.
Were they defeated on the mission...?
{NEWPAGE}

Or are they ashamed of losing,
Perhaps they are unable to return.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because {Crusader} isn't here,
I feel like the monsters have increased.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't fight monsters, but my great 42+88.task 42+56. is to
42+89. support {Crusader}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Though it doesn't come out of {Luzzu}'s 42+90. mouth,
They're quite depressed.
{NEWPAGE}

The 42+91.42+92. of letting {Gatta} die
They're probably keenly feeling it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Around the time {Gatta} returned from the mission,
they were terribly depressed.
{NEWPAGE}

After they started leading {Crusader},
they finally cheered up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Overcome by the poisonous energy, everything
it seems they've forgotten.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well now, I'll tell you then.
What do you want to hear?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30} "Shin"?
{CHOICE:31} The poisonous air?
{CHOICE:32} Ebon?
{CHOICE:33} Zanarkand?
{CHOICE:34} I won't ask.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30} "Shin"?
{CHOICE:31} The poisonous air?
{CHOICE:32} Ebon?
{CHOICE:33} Zanarkand?
{CHOICE:34} The Great Summoner?
{CHOICE:35} I won't ask.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you listen to my story, you might also...
...recall your own self.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Are there other things you want to hear?
...perhaps?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Good heavens! To think...
...you've even forgotten '{Sin}'?!
{NEWPAGE}

Even if they wish to forget, many people have unforgettable feelings...
...and yet...
{NEWPAGE}

{Sin} appeared 1000 years ago and...
...is a monster that plagues this land of {Spira}.
{NEWPAGE}

All the people born in {Spira}...
...are suffering from {Sin}.
{NEWPAGE}

To think you'd even forget {Sin}...
Well, perhaps that way you'd be happier.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Sin} appeared 1000 years ago and...
...is a monster that plagues this land of {Spira}.
{NEWPAGE}

All the people born in {Spira}...
...are suffering from {Sin}.
{NEWPAGE}

To think you'd even forget {Sin}...
Well, perhaps that way you'd be happier.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Wafting out from {Sin}'s body...
...is tainted air.
{NEWPAGE}

If you breathe that in, the contents of your head...
...get all muddled up.
{NEWPAGE}

That's why anyone who gets close to {Sin}...
...easily forgets even important things.
{NEWPAGE}

Just like you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To forget {Yevon2}'s teachings...
How deplorable...
{NEWPAGE}

To help the people suffering from '{Sin}'.
It is a great teaching.
{NEWPAGE}

Before you were overcome by the poison...
You should have been living according to the teaching.
{NEWPAGE}

Offer diligent prayers at the temple.
You should remember the teaching.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Long, long ago, it flourished in the far north.
It was the capital 42+94.
{NEWPAGE}

However, 1000 years ago,
It was destroyed by '{Sin}'.
{NEWPAGE}

They were relying on machines and 42+95. grew complacent.
They must have received divine retribution.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Those who once fought against '{Sin}'.
I'm referring to the four Summoners.
{NEWPAGE}

{Ohalland}, {Gandof}, {Yocun}.
And {Braska}.
{NEWPAGE}

That this {Spira} was not destroyed by '{Sin}'
is thanks to the Great Summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Now, I am looking after you.
I can't look after it, but don't take it as a favor.
{NEWPAGE}

Because the Junior Summoner-sama hasn't returned from the trial.
The village's 42+96. are terribly anxious.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm so worried, so very worried...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Before setting out on your journey, don't you want to know various things?
(No separate line, combined with 5)
--------------------------------------------------End--

They say {Aurochs} won for the first time in 23 years,
there are 42+97. challengers, but...
{NEWPAGE}

That {Aurochs} couldn't possibly win.
I won't be fooled!
--------------------------------------------------End--

It seems your malice has completely left you.
It is a blessing from {Yevon2}, how grateful...
--------------------------------------------------End--

We, the people of {Besaid},
all believe in {Yuna}-sama!
{NEWPAGE}

{Braska}-sama's daughter
would not possibly defy the temple.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What the temple's important people are thinking...
the common folk don't understand.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Until I witness 『{Sin}』's collapse,
I will live a little longer.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I like Lord Oharand the 42+99.most.
You really resemble my deceased grandpa.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord {Braska} is with you.
It's sure to return.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What is this 42+55.yafuri?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I have nothing to talk about with a 42+55.yafuri.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do not disturb my prayer.
You 42+55.yafuri!
--------------------------------------------------End--

What? You're the guard!?
...Are you still affected by the poisonous air?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Surely not, you wouldn't... Lord {Yuna}...
...trick Lord __P0__, did you?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Until Lord {Yuna}'s Nagi-do arrives...
I decided to pray 42+101.daily, 42+102.without fail.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When Nagi-do arrives, the new Great Summoner's...
We must 42+103.enshrine the sacred statue, hmm?
--------------------------------------------------End--

For someone affected by the poisonous air...
...you seem energetic, you.
{NEWPAGE}

Probably because you didn't inhale much of the poisonous air...
...that's why, isn't it?
{NEWPAGE}

Being a Blitz player means...
You must be good at holding your breath.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I also thought about playing Blitz in the past, but...
42+83.I couldn't endure holding my breath...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Besaid} 42+64.things 42+64.kept at our place...
...are popular on the continent too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If we only uphold 42+65.tradition forever,
We won't become 42+104.a shell.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When 42+77. was a 42+105.child, the village...
...was 42+87.attacked by '{Sin}'.
{NEWPAGE}

That day the village became a 42+106.wasteland...
I still dream of it, even now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Something must have happened...
--------------------------------------------------End--

But even the previous Summoner...
...almost their life...
--------------------------------------------------End--

...Sorry.
--------------------------------------------------End--

42+77.We can only pray.
Since we're 42+55., it can't be helped.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That {Kilika} was 42+87.attacked means...
T- Next, it might be {Besaid}'s turn...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I get distracted because {Sin} is scary, but...
If I mess up, the old man is scary...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Maybe {Aurochs} won because I prayed for 42+101.days.

--------------------------------------------------End--

They say you'll get 42+107.money if you report information about rebels.
(No translation for this line, combined with #5)
{NEWPAGE}

People here don't snitch, but...
Be careful in other lands.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder what's happening on the continent?
Not much information comes through.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It seems Lady Yuna's false accusation has been 42+108.
(No translation for this line, combined with #11)
--------------------------------------------------End--

If only {Sin} would disappear...
Then there would be nothing to say, right...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

How can I focus on 42+56.work when the Calm is about to arrive?
(No translation for this line, combined with #15)
--------------------------------------------------End--

May Jusho-sama return 42+56.safely...
(No translation for this line, combined with #17)
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Yevon2}'s teachings are the 42+109.of our hearts.
{NEWPAGE}

If there were no teachings, we would be afraid of {Sin}.
I don't think I can bear 42+66.rashe.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's like we were born just to fear 『{Sin}』...
(No separate translation; combined with line 2)
--------------------------------------------------End--

May {Yevon2}'s blessing be upon Jushou-sama...
(No separate translation; combined with line 4)
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please guide {Yuna}-sama's journey...
(No separate translation; combined with line 6)
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I think of {Yuna}-sama's future journey,
no matter how many lines of prayer, I feel it won't be enough.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If {Lulu} is with us,
it will surely be alright...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because of the machines, many {Crusader} people
died, I heard...
{NEWPAGE}

To turn a precious life into 42+110.42+111. is
unforgivable.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You be careful not to break the teachings.
(No separate translation; combined with line 16)
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's regrettable that the yuu42+112. of {Yuna}-sama and {Master Seymor}
was lost.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Yuna}-sama would never go against the teachings.
Isn't that right?
--------------------------------------------------End--

May the next Nagi level last as long as possible.
続くことを祈るわ
--------------------------------------------------End--

May Auraka score at least one point...
取れますように……
--------------------------------------------------End--

Since {Wakka} is a Guard too, they should go help.
助けに行けばいいんだよ
--------------------------------------------------End--

I decided to pray for Lord {Yuna} for [42+101] days.
お祈りするって決めたんだ
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard that Lord {Braska} and two Guards came to the village around the time I was born.
ふたりのガードが 村に来たんだってさ
--------------------------------------------------End--

May Lord {Yuna} quickly defeat '{Sin}' ...
やっつけてくれますように……
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Priest Official told us the story of Lord {Yunalesca} and Lord {Zaon}.
お話を聞かせてくれたよ
{NEWPAGE}

The current {Yunalesca} exists because Lord {Yunalesca} worked hard, doesn't it?
今の{Spira} が あるんだよね
--------------------------------------------------End--

If I were as strong as Lord {Zaon}, I could have become a Guard too...
ぼくもガードになれたのになあ
--------------------------------------------------End--

One who is not a Guard...
Do not approach the Hall of Trials.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you pray devoutly,
Even the poison will likely be cured.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The sacred statues of the Great Summoners are, from the right,
Lord {Braska}, Lord Yonkun...
{NEWPAGE}

Lord Oharando and Lord Gandofu.
Well? Did you recall?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Let's put the matter of 42+55.Yafuli aside for now.
Let's celebrate the 42+113.birth of a new 42+114.summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Come on, quickly to the village square! You too,
Please 42+115.share in the 42+68.joy.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It is also partly due to the poison.
Let's overlook the matter of 42+55.Yafuli.
{NEWPAGE}

However, only this time.
From now on, you must follow the teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The youths of {Crusader} are planning a strategy that goes against {Yevon2}'s teachings.
...
{NEWPAGE}

It's regrettable... for lives to be lost by breaking the teachings.
For {Chappu} alone to lose their life is enough.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Your complexion has improved since the other day, hasn't it?
Has the toxic effect of 『{Sin} 』 worn off?
--------------------------------------------------End--

A Summoner is currently undertaking a trial.
You must not interfere.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We have not yet informed the islanders, but...
They say {Maester Mika2} has passed away...
{NEWPAGE}

What on earth is happening at {Bevelle}?
(Combined with 6)
--------------------------------------------------End--

If the temple is in chaos,
only anxiety will spread among the people.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A flying ship... could it possibly be {Al Bhed}'s
machine?
{NEWPAGE}

Whether it is right to provide aid,
I am somewhat conflicted.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if I examine {Yevon2}'s [42+80.42+116.], a
method to relieve the toxic effects of 『__P1__ 』 is not recorded.
{NEWPAGE}

If you possess {Yevon2}'s [42+60.mi],
the toxic effects might be removed...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I will also pray that you may be granted {Yevon2}'s [42+60.mi].
(Combined with 18)
--------------------------------------------------End--

The most favorable outcome might occur.
My heart aches as well.
{NEWPAGE}

However, if we do not overcome this trial...
That person will have no future...
--------------------------------------------------End--

To acquire immense power...
...it entails considerable suffering.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When {Crusader} returns...
...I will welcome her warmly.
{NEWPAGE}

To return them to the path of correct teachings...
...is the duty of one who serves as a temple official.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Summoner's journey seems to be going smoothly.
Hmm, very well, very well.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The communication from {St. Bevelle} Palace...
...has been cut off.
{NEWPAGE}

The temples in various places are in a flurry.
How regrettable...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I could not approach the temple for a while.
That's right.
{NEWPAGE}

Rest assured, no matter what others do...
...this temple will protect you all.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even the teachings of {Yevon2} that have lasted 1000 years...
It seems you are facing a major turning point.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If {Sin} perishes, then {Yevon2}'s
teachings might also come to an end.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people of {Besaid} very faithfully
uphold the teachings of {Yevon2}.
{NEWPAGE}

Even I, a monastic official, am taught
many things by the people.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I understand {Crusader}'s feelings well, but...
Going against the teachings is a problem.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Watched over by the sacred statue, Lord Jūshō
must also be full of enthusiasm.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Are you alright regarding {Sin}'s poisonous aura?
Praying at the temple is the quickest way to recover.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Excuse me, but could you please
leave me alone?
{NEWPAGE}

Because I am praying for that person's safety...
しておりますので……
--------------------------------------------------End--

You too, please offer prayers
along with the villagers.
--------------------------------------------------End--

From now on, not Lord Jūshō...
I must meet with Lord/Lady {Yuna}...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh, Yafuri-san, from now on...
You must properly observe the teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord/Lady Summoner, in order to help the people,
will embark on an arduous journey.
{NEWPAGE}

We must offer heartfelt prayers.
We must do so.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The poison will surely be cured.
You must not be afraid.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I understand {Crusader}'s feelings, but...
Going against the teachings is a problem.
--------------------------------------------------End--

All of the islanders are praying for Lord/Lady {Yuna}'s
safety.
{NEWPAGE}

Of course, I am the same.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord/Lady {Yuna}'s accomplishments are reaching even this island.
They are being conveyed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear you have become a Guard.
I'm counting on you, Lord/Lady {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The order to capture Lord/Lady {Yuna}...
...has been conveyed even to {Besaid}.
{NEWPAGE}

Both the islanders and the temple officials are bewildered.
That shouldn't be possible...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks who came to the island are terrible troublemakers...
They're no different from thugs.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Now that {Maester Mika2} is gone, the people of {Yevon2}...
Who should they rely on?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I have followed {Yevon2}'s teachings since childhood.
I have followed them.
{NEWPAGE}

Even if the temple is ruined...
I know no other way but to pray.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Besaid} products being made here...
They're quite good.
{NEWPAGE}

If we buy them cheaply and sell them...
We'll definitely make a profit.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Look, even with the whole village in an uproar...
They calmly continue their work.
{NEWPAGE}

That's impressive.
That's how merchants should be.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Of course, I'm worried too!
But... the people have no choice but to wait.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That old man, abandoning his work...
They went to see the Summoner off.
{NEWPAGE}

Because of that, the work was forced upon me.
Honestly, it's not right.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't indulge in idle talk.
If I'm lazy, that dog will be annoying.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if a reinforcement joins, {Aurochs}...
I don't think it will get stronger.
{NEWPAGE}

Anyway, it'll be a first-round defeat again this year. The championship...
The championship is decided by our {Luca Goers}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Crusader}'s strategy, regarding {Yevon2}'s teachings...
I hear that __P0__'s strategy goes against __P1__'s teachings.
{NEWPAGE}

They are a pushy group despite being weak.
They should just leave it to the Summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard, at the {Luca} tournament...
You performed brilliantly, didn't you?
{NEWPAGE}

Well, thanks to the {Aurochs} effect...
The popularity of {Besaid} goods might rise too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard {Crusader} suffered a crushing defeat.
They are an ungrateful lot.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I was impressed by the old man.
{NEWPAGE}

Even if 『{Sin} 』 comes right in front of you.
You'll probably keep doing your 仕42+56., I suppose.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh! Rebels!
They're an insolent bunch!
--------------------------------------------------End--

……42+132.42+133. they say.
Don't glare at me like that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear the temples on the continent are in chaos, it's terrible.
Good grief, this is hopeless.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I didn't believe the stories about flying ships.
A ship flying, that's like something out of a dream, isn't it?
{NEWPAGE}

So, when the ship actually flew here...
I was almost scared out of my wits.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When the ship flew here, the old man also...
He was singing while doing his 仕42+56.!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Searching for a land without 『{Sin} 』.
I've been traveling, but...
{NEWPAGE}

There's no such land anywhere, I see.
It seems better to give up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The village where I was born is no longer there.
It was wiped out by 『{Sin} 』.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because the villagers are worried.
It's better to keep quiet.
{NEWPAGE}

Just because they're affected by the poison...
Making a fuss is forbidden.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Several villagers to the pier
Went to check.
{NEWPAGE}

Even if they look for the traveling Summoner...
It'll only make things more painful, won't it...
--------------------------------------------------End--

You must be careful not to break the teachings.
Otherwise, you'll be excommunicated like {Crusader}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A Summoner named {Isaaru} came to the village.
But they disappeared quickly...
--------------------------------------------------End--

As expected, {Crusader}'s plan failed.
It's because they rely on machines.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Crusader}, which was destroyed by {Operation Mi'ihen},
Is regaining its power in the wasteland, they say.
{NEWPAGE}

In contrast, the warrior monks' reputation is most excellent.
They are holed up in {Bevelle} and aren't coming out, they say.
--------------------------------------------------End--

For the excommunicated {Crusader} to be protecting the people...
It's strange, somehow...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I also learn about {Besaid}.
I wonder if I should try staying here...
--------------------------------------------------End--

With something like a song, can we really defeat 『{Sin}』?
I'm uneasy, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A sailor's work has many worries.
I have to relax once in a while.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That 『{Sin}』 appeared in the nearby waters...
Is the rumor true?
{NEWPAGE}

This is bad... the Riki-go's departure...
Even though it's soon...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please, please, even on the next voyage...
May we not meet 『{Sin}』...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yesterday, Lord Juushou and others heading towards the temple...
I saw them.
{NEWPAGE}

Because they looked well, I thought they would be alright...
Even though I was thinking that... it can't be.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wish to see their lively figures
once more.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I will, until the next ship comes,
relax in this village.
--------------------------------------------------End--

42+139. There's no time to rest underwater.
I'm constantly on edge about 『{Sin} 』.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you dawdle,
the ferry will leave.
{NEWPAGE}

The next ship won't come for a while.
If you miss it, it'll be a big problem.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please, please, even on the next voyage...
May we not meet 『{Sin}』...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Near the island, {Al Bhed2}'s ship...
...someone saw.
{NEWPAGE}

Those guys, for what purpose...
...did they come here, I wonder?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I like this village. Giving up being a sailor...
...and living here might be good.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My friend is on the ferry.
I'll pray for his sake.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Guado2}'s guys apparently blew up {Al Bhed2}'s...
...dwelling.
{NEWPAGE}

No matter how helpful {Al Bhed} is, it's too much.
They did cruel things.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if the temple is in chaos,
this village is quiet.
--------------------------------------------------End--

May the temple's confusion subside.
I wonder if it's strange to pray?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The way the flying ship fought was amazing.
Maybe we should re-evaluate {Al Bhed}'s people.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
Discovered {Jecht}'s sphere!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
Have a look at {CHOICE:30}.
Do not look at {CHOICE:31}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
