{Lucil} 
I have received the communication.
Please hurry to the Operations Command ahead.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
Master, with the Summoner present,
the morale of the unit members has also risen.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
Of course, I am likewise.
Thank you!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
Depending on the operation's development,
many casualties will occur.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
At that time, Summoner,
please, perform 'Otherworld Departure'.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
There is a possibility this place could also become a battlefield,
so please be careful!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
Oh, Summoners!
How did you get in?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
If the guards are with you,
the Summoner must be safe.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
Just because we use machines, at this point,
no making a fuss now!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
By earning merit in the operation,
I'll get recognized by Captain {Lucil}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Monster activity is increasing.
It's just a small comfort, but please.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You are the Summoner's party, aren't you?
Please accept this!
--------------------------------------------------End--

After the operation is over, in the town of {Luca}...
I'll thoroughly enjoy myself with my comrades.
{NEWPAGE}

I've already reserved 42+55. too.
So I'll definitely return alive!
--------------------------------------------------End--

If the operation succeeds, the temple too...
I wonder if they'll lift the excommunication...?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
Ultimately, my persuasion wasn't enough.
I couldn't stop the operation.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
But when I see the people of {Crusader}...
It's painful to do nothing...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
So now, with what I can do...
I'm hoping I can be of help.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
I don't have the strength to fight, but...
I have some knowledge of 'White Magic'.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
Now, I want to apply that power.
That's what I'm thinking.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
Do you have anything to respond to?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
Take care!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
Haa... haa...
