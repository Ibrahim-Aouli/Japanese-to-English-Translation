In this world -- Spira, two years have passed since the Eternal Calm arrived.
--------------------------------------------------End--
I got a new life.
--------------------------------------------------End--
The days of walking together with Yuna continued for one year.
--------------------------------------------------End--
It was fun -- yeah, really.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Krugum and I were walking on Bevelle's Stadium Street --
-- formerly Mika Street.
--------------------------------------------------End--
The stadium, which should have been completed as planned,
is still 42+53.ing its framework.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Can a tournament really be held --
--------------------------------------------------End--
If it can't be held, Spira's 42+54. Council
how do they intend to take 42+55.42+56. --
--------------------------------------------------End--
Well, it doesn't matter.
Because it has nothing to do with me.
--------------------------------------------------End--
The problem is the crowd right in front and the star 42+57.ing in its center.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Krugum: Hey, Chiami.
That's not the way. We have to hurry.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chiami: You're the one waiting, so 42+58.42+59. boldly.
More importantly, look, that's Tidus, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Krugum: Huh? -- Oh, you're right!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chiami: Let's take a respectful look at their 42+60.42+61. up close.
--------------------------------------------------End--
--Mm.
--------------------------------------------------End--
What? What are you 42+62.42+63.ing?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Ahaha.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} The reason Kurugumu is frozen like a stone is...
Tidus is a Blitzball...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} It's not because he's a superstar.
It's because he's one of the so-called legendary guardians.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} The man who saved Spira together with High Summoner Yuna.
That is the 42+64.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} By the way, I'm also a little bit 42+62.42+63.ing.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} That 42+64. is--
Because 42+65. should know my father 42+66.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yes, thanks!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Your 42+67. support, please!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Alright!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Thanks, thanks!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Tidus, please 42+68.42+63.!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Alright!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} Alright!
It wasn't just that 42+70. word that was 42+69.
--------------------------------------------------End--
The hand that 42+71.held had no 42+72.strength at all.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Then I have to go.
See you at the stadium next time!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Really--he's like a star.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Well, I admit it. But--
--------------------------------------------------End--
What's wrong?
--------------------------------------------------End--
He's injured.
Maybe he's not feeling well--
--------------------------------------------------End--
Hey, Kurgum, who are the tournament 42+73.win 42+74.candidates?
--------------------------------------------------End--
As expected, it'll be the Besaid Aurochs.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Who's next strongest?
--------------------------------------------------End--
The Al Bhed Psyches, I guess.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Alright, let's go to the 42+75.betting shop. Maybe we can make a big 42+76.profit.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami, that kind of thing--I'm not so sure.
--------------------------------------------------End--
I'll 42+77.42+78. again.
This is my 42+79.acquaintance, Kurgum.
--------------------------------------------------End--
In another era, he'd be a Lord Summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--
But now, he's a Spira 42+54.Council-certified 42+80.42+81.Guide.
He specializes in Farplane 42+80.sending.
--------------------------------------------------End--
And I am Chuami.
I am supposed to be Kurugumu's assistant.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} But, I am the one actually making the arrangements.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} Please don't misunderstand.
It's not a relationship of love or anything like that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} Not in the future either.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} I don't know anything about the future, but...
I am certain of that much.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} This is not a prelude.
To repeat, this is not a prelude.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Kurugumu: Hey, let's go.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chiami: Alright.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} We, as the representative of Spira 42+54. Council 42+89. Chairman Baralai,
were supposed to fly to Besaid Island.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} Well, it's just an errand.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Kurugumu: Is that Besaid Island, I wonder?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chiami: Idiot, it's Kilika.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Captain: Besaid shortly. Take landing position!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chiami: Did you hear that?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Kurugumu: No way!
Chiami: --Ugh, it hurts-- Stop!
--------------------------------------------------End--
機長：Landing mode42+90.! Ruhodachigoko! (You brats.)
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} Our purpose is to meet that person.
High Summoner Yuna.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} Currently, she holds the position of Ebonar's advisor.
Ebonar is... that, as you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} Era42+92.42+93.'s42+94.ancient42+95.42+96.
Guardians of morals and rules42+97..
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} The uproar42+99. caused by the radical42+98. Ebonars has subsided, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} The fact that such groups42+97. still exist in this Spira...
To be honest, it's unpleasant.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} I dislike Ebonar.
That being said, three years ago, she defeated 'Sin', and...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} ...the heroine who freed Spira from a curse of 42+100. years...
...it would be a lie to say I had no interest.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} That woman42+65. should also know my father42+66. well.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Lulu: So? What exactly is the council42+54.'s business?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Krugum: My apologies42+101.42+102., Chief Lulu.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Krugum: The instructions are to tell High Summoner Yuna directly.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: I see. If that's the case, then it can't be helped--
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: That's not how it's going to work.
Many people say such things.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Rurue: We are here to prevent Yuna from 42+104.
So, what's your business?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Krugum: However－－
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: Even so, I understand your 42+105. too. Let's do this.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: I'll 42+106. you to Yuna's place,
We'll hear her out together. It's a compromise.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} I thought, "You won't be hurt by that," but
I had the good sense to stay silent.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} The village chief of this big 42+107. also,
The dull-witted Ebana caretaker is also a 伝脱 guard.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} Someday, I will come to 42+108. about my father 42+66.
42+109.ing here is not a 42+110. way.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: This place was 42+111.ed the Corridor of Trials.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: Since then, there have been no Fayth,
So now it's just a passage, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: Summoners passed through here, and in the most 42+112. room,
They would meet the Fayth.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: Yuna is there now.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami: What is Lady Yuna doing there?
The Fayth are no longer here, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Even if the Fayth are gone, we pray.
That's Yuna's way now.
--------------------------------------------------End--
What might she be praying for?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Spira's peace.
Sounds like a lie.
--------------------------------------------------End--
What did you say?
--------------------------------------------------End--
It's nothing. Um, Wakka.
--------------------------------------------------End--
I don't quite understand Eboner, but...
The revival of the Yevon Temple isn't its goal, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
What? Is that where we start?
--------------------------------------------------End--
But it's important, so remember it well.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Eboner, like the old Yevon Temple,
isn't thinking of controlling the world with its teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--
It's just about living by cherishing the teachings.
That is all.
--------------------------------------------------End--
It's one way of life.
--------------------------------------------------End--
I don't understand the difference from the past, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--
The Temple was always telling enormous lies.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Things like 'Sin' being the embodiment of human sins, or
That using machina makes sins heavier, things like that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
But, other than that, he was saying proper things.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Be grateful for {42+72.}'s {42+117.}, and {42+118.}{42+119.}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{42+120.} people should cherish each other--
I think those are all obvious things, though?
--------------------------------------------------End--
It's not like you particularly have to become an Eboder and...
...even without praying--
--------------------------------------------------End--
That's why, everyone has their own way of life. It's {42+64.}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
How old are you, {42+115.}?
--------------------------------------------------End--
I'm seventeen.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Then you'll understand soon.
--------------------------------------------------End--
When you become an adult, things like ways of life...
...can't be changed that {42+121.}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Even if times change,
there are also people who are helpless.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Eboners are a group of those kinds of people.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Is it {42+85.} from New Ebon {42+122.}?
--------------------------------------------------End--
That was just an attempt to gain {42+123.} using Ebon's name,
its content was forward-looking.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Then Eboners seem to be backward-looking.
--------------------------------------------------End--
That's not what I mean.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: Anyway, New Yevon 42+122. is gone, and now it's the 42+54. Council.
There's no use talking about it now, is there?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami: From what I hear, the Yevonites are, in other words...
...a gathering of weak people?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Kurgum: Chuami!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: --Don't say such things so proudly.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: Everyone knows. They're aware.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami: If they are aware, instead of just 42+124.ji42+125.motte naide in a place like this...
...they should 42+68.42+63. and 42+126. it outside.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami: By praying, and believing that they themselves are 42+127.motteiru Spira's peace 42+114....
...are conceited and satisfied with that--
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: Chuami, that was it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: Be 42+73.. Be 42+128..
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: A way of thinking like yours hurts those people.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} The way he said "those people" bothered me.
It's as if they're strangers 42+113..
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: Well then, wait here. I'll go 42+111. Yuna.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: Just convey your message.
If you tangle with her like you did with me, I'll throw you out.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} "Tangled"--Perhaps that's true.
42+129. was 42+105.ing.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} Pray for Spira's 42+114. -- now, such a thing...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} My 42+130.42+66. died caught in Ebon's 42+131.ri.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} Struck down by the hunters' 42+132., bled from 42+107. and died.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} It wasn't Ebon.
I just sympathized with those people.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} If the Ebonites weren't here--
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami, I understand, but now, 42+133.
We must fulfill our 42+134. duty.
--------------------------------------------------End--
I know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Let's 42+123. -- Oh, it's Lady Yuna.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Hello. Welcome to Ebon's 42+135., Besaid.
--------------------------------------------------End--
I am Yuna, the Summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Nice to meet you.
My name is Kurugumu. I am an authorized 42+80.42+81. specialist.
--------------------------------------------------End--
I've wanted to meet Lady Yuna for a long time--
--------------------------------------------------End--
Also, from 42+54. Chairman Baralai--
I have a 42+137. delivery.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Um--
Is that so? Then leave that and-- please leave.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wait, were you listening to what he said?
--------------------------------------------------End--
He said he's wanted to meet you this whole time, didn't he?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Since awakening, how much he's thought about this day－－
No, it's fine. You're busy, aren't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Kurgum, you be quiet.
--------------------------------------------------End--
But Lady Yuna said she was 42+139.sy－－
Even if you say you're 42+139.sy, you still eat, don't you? You still sleep, don't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--
With a guest who came all the way from Bevelle,
and there's no time to talk for just a little bit? What does that mean!?
--------------------------------------------------End--
－－I'm sorry.
Because I interrupted my prayer, I'm unsettled.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Even if you don't pray that much,
I think Spira is 42+114.ceful, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Sure, minor disturbances happen here and there,
but the 42+54.ncil usually takes care of it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yes, that's right.
Huh?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Hey, no more of that talk.
You brought something, didn't you? Hand it over quickly.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yes, um－－it's this.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} Kurgum [42+143.] from Chairman Baralai [42+54.].
Handed the [42+144.] image sphere to Yuna.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} The setting of the [42+144.] image that the sphere [42+144.] projected was the Moonflow.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} A giant, but an animal with [42+145.] love.
Shuparf is [42+144.].
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} Two Shuparf are [42+146.][42+147.], appearing friendly.
Forming a long [42+148.] bond --
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: Two Shuparf!?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Kurgum: It seems they had suddenly [42+72.] increased one [42+149.].
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: Where did they come from?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: The Moonflow's Shuparf should have been the last one.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Kurgum: Until thirty years ago, there were [42+119.][42+150.] Shuparf, but...
It seems the female was [42+151.] by 'Sin' and died.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Kurgum: The elders [42+146.] are [42+152.] saying that it's the Shuparf from that time, it seems.
(See line 14)
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna: A [42+111.][42+146.] -- isn't it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: Ah, that's the only explanation.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna: But now [42+153.] it's not Yevon's.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna: Because I forbade [42+111.][42+146.] outside the Farplane.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Kurgum: I don't understand the [42+113.].
--------------------------------------------------End--
But Chairman Baralai 42+54. would very much like Lady Yuna to see it.
After that, he 42+155. to meet 42+154. in Bevelle.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Hey, Krugum. You're a 42+80.42+81.士, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yes.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Then, you can do it too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
This Shipaafu is an illusion shown by the Genkou.
If you 42+80., it's over.
--------------------------------------------------End--
The problem isn't just that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
The Genkou is 42+156. again.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Well, the Genkou is 42+157. around the Genkou River originally, but...
This kind of thing-- if it were 42+158. it would be impossible.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Investigation and resolution of the 42+159. cause are necessary, and also...
--------------------------------------------------End--
After all, the one who 42+111.び42+146. this Shipaafu is...
who it is, is also a problem.
--------------------------------------------------End--
According to my 42+160.,
The 42+54. Council believes it's Yevon's doing.
--------------------------------------------------End--
So, for Lady Yuna to come...
Having the 42+54. Council 42+101.し開き is best.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Because everyone respects Lady Yuna.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Baralai's 42+103. -- You dared to 42+161. Yuna!
--------------------------------------------------End--
ワッカ：You're telling me to choose my own {42+54} council member, huh?
ユウナ：－－Wakka-san
--------------------------------------------------End--
ワッカ：It was a promise not to involve Yuna in {42+163} politics.
ワッカ：That's why Yuna can't do something like this－－
--------------------------------------------------End--
チュアミ：Something like this?
--------------------------------------------------End--
ユウナ：I'm sorry, I can't go.
--------------------------------------------------End--
ユウナ：But then you'll all be {42+164}, won't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--
ユウナ：Okay, let's do this.
--------------------------------------------------End--
ユウナ：I'll make a Letter Sphere addressed to the {42+54} Council, so－－
ユウナ：Take that and go back, and then－－
--------------------------------------------------End--
チュアミ：I met Tidus-san in Bevelle.
チュアミ：He's a {42+87} person, isn't he?
--------------------------------------------------End--
ユウナ：－－Uh-huh. Was he doing well?
--------------------------------------------------End--
チュアミ：He was hiding it, but it seems he's injured.
--------------------------------------------------End--
ユウナ：－－Really? Wakka-san, are you listening?
--------------------------------------------------End--
ワッカ：Nope.
--------------------------------------------------End--
チュアミ：He's probably trying not to cause worry.
--------------------------------------------------End--
クルグム：Chuami－－
--------------------------------------------------End--
ユウナ：I see－－ So that's how it is－－
--------------------------------------------------End--
ワッカ：Yuna, let's {42+154} Lulu.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yes.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} After we left the temple, we for a little while...
were left alone.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} I don't know what those people talked about.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} But more than the problems happening on the mainland...
{42+87} people's injuries definitely moved Yuna.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Hey, Krugum.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Hmm?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Somehow, {42+129} {42+105}...
--------------------------------------------------End--
But I seem to be able to fulfill my {42+134} duty.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Also, I get to talk with Lady Yuna just a little more.
--------------------------------------------------End--
How summoners live in a world without Fayth--
I've always wanted to {42+154}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami, you too, about Sir Auron--
--------------------------------------------------End--
Shh! If they knew I'm that person's {42+165}...
Everyone would {42+166} themselves, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
This information is the ultimate weapon, so--
--------------------------------------------------End--
You're Sir Auron's {42+165}, you say?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Village Elder!?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Is that true?
--------------------------------------------------End--
--It's true.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Heh heh.
--------------------------------------------------End--
I 42+91.ed! I just 42+91.ed!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Have you ever made them 42+126. all at once?
--------------------------------------------------End--
--No, but I often heard from 42+130..
--------------------------------------------------End--
Have you ever met them?
--------------------------------------------------End--
I don't remember because I was small.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Hmm.
--------------------------------------------------End--
And there's no 42+152.42+167. that I am 42+85..
--------------------------------------------------End--
You don't 42+168. at all, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Because 42+130.42+66.42+168..
--------------------------------------------------End--
There were also children who 42+168.ed more.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Eh?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Auron, Braska, Jecht--
--------------------------------------------------End--
To the fraudulent people who claim to be the child 42+169. of these people,
I met many 42+90. of them, who said 'Hand over the 遗42+170.!'
--------------------------------------------------End--
Are you saying that I am one of them too?
Are you saying 42+130. is a liar!?
--------------------------------------------------End--
I wouldn't go that far.
But if Mr. Auron had a child 42+169.--
--------------------------------------------------End--
Rulu: You couldn't possibly not remember.
And he wouldn't hide anything from us.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Rulu: Auron is that kind of person.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{TAG} Just because {TAG} is big, and {TAG} like that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{TAG} Just because you know Auron, you say whatever you want.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{TAG} That village chief, declared an enemy.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{TAG} Fine. I'll settle this someday.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{TAG} Now, as for us--
--------------------------------------------------End--
{TAG} That is, Yuna, Kurugumu.
And Wakka, who was accompanying {TAG},
--------------------------------------------------End--
{TAG} Before going to Bevelle, we decided to {TAG} to the Moonflow.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{TAG} The airship couldn't fly due to {TAG}{TAG}.
The journey was more difficult than expected.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{TAG} Moreover, the Moonflow, for the increased shoopufs, was with jeering {TAG} and {TAG} all at once--
(Continued from 14)
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: Oh, you're right, you're right! There are two shoopufs!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: Still, that's an incredible jeering {TAG}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna: Wakka, it seems a little {TAG}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: Huh? If it's not jeering {TAG}, then what is it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna: Half of the people here are phantoms.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna: Phantoms shown by spectral light that defy the will 42+67. of the living.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna: It's become just like the otherworld.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Kurugumu: --Yes.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami: Huh, Kurugumu, even you can tell?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Kurugumu: Yeah, I can tell.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Kurugumu: For example-- look, that family over there.
The girl and the father are among the living, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--
Kurugumu: Father 42+130. is-- poor thing.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami: Me, I haven't even been to the Otherworld 42+176. but...
So it's this lifelike.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna: I wonder if I'm a little 42+85.u. Certainly, it's just like the real thing--
--------------------------------------------------End--
Father 42+66.: Come on, Meiru.
It'll be night soon if we don't go home.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Meiru: Yeah, hey, Father 42+130.
Father 42+130., you're coming home with me too, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Father 42+66.: That's not how it works.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Meiru: Why? I came all this way to see you!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Father 42+66.: --Come on, Meiru, let's come again.
If you come here, we can meet again.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Meiru: No! I want to go home together!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami: Ugh... My useless Father{42+66}.
It was bound to happen.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami: It's the remaining {42+177}, right?
To part with {42+130}{42+66} twice... when I died and today...
--------------------------------------------------End--
Meiru: Hey, O{42+130}san.
You'll return, right? This isn't a permanent departure, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{42+130}{42+66}: Yes, Meiru. Let's return.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Meiru: Really!?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Father{42+66}: No way--
--------------------------------------------------End--
Kurugumu: Yuuna-sama, this is--
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuuna: Unbelievable--
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami: Kurugumu, explain!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Kurugumu: Phantoms that appear by {42+111}bi{42+146}se don't speak.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Kurugumu: To be precise, only the person who {42+111}bi{42+146}seta them can hear their voice.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami: Then, what?
If it's not an illusion, it's usually called the real thing{42+158}, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuuna: We might need to report it to the council{42+54} quickly.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami: Yes, let's go back.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami: Wait-- Kurugumu!
Hey! What are you planning to do?! Idiot, are you trying to {42+178}ru?
--------------------------------------------------End--
If I don't 42+80. it, 42+179.42+180. will become disordered.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Kurgum, let's stop now. Everyone will be sad.
--------------------------------------------------End--
But this is strange. It's not good.
It's unnatural.
--------------------------------------------------End--
The 42+54. Council knows about this,
--------------------------------------------------End--
So they showed it to Lady Yuna, right?
To make something happen.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Even so, not now.
No one has the 42+181. right to interrupt this reunion.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Neither do we, nor the 42+54. Council.
--------------------------------------------------End--
42+181. rights or whatever, forget about that for now.
Look at everyone's happy 42+61.s.
--------------------------------------------------End--
If you 42+80. everything back to the Farplane now,
Both of you will be 42+182. like an octopus.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Even I'll get dragged into it. Please 42+84.42+183. me.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Well, just by 42+80.ing from the Farplane a little,
it won't settle down, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
It looks like we should try again later.
--------------------------------------------------End--
But--
Kurgum, please.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} And we returned to Bevelle.
--------------------------------------------------End--
クルグム: Chuami, are you there?
--------------------------------------------------End--
チュアミ: Hmph!
--------------------------------------------------End--
チュアミ: What are we waiting for?
--------------------------------------------------End--
クルグム: Rather—
チュアミ: Rather!?
--------------------------------------------------End--
チュアミ: What could be more important than my 42+82.question?
Could there be? Doesn't seem so.
--------------------------------------------------End--
クルグム: If 42+136. decided to stop sending the departed...
Lady Yuna looked relieved, didn't she?
--------------------------------------------------End--
チュアミ: I guess so.
--------------------------------------------------End--
クルグム: I thought Lady Yuna was a just person...
--------------------------------------------------End--
チュアミ: You're too 42+185.. You expect too much.
--------------------------------------------------End--
クルグム: Yes—perhaps.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} Looking back now, I should have anticipated this outcome.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} What I saw in the Moonflow wasn't mere 42+186.monition...
__P0__ It was a much clearer 42+187.42+188. of revival.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} Before my eyes—there was Sin.
--------------------------------------------------End--
クルグム: Sin—no way.
--------------------------------------------------End--
クルグム: It's a 42+116., right, Chuami?
That's a huge monster, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna: No--that is "Sin."
"Sin," who should no longer be here.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Krugum: Someone 42+133.d--
Are you saying they 42+111. 42+146.d it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna: Yes. They strongly, strongly sought "Sin."
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami: A-And, but what are we going to do?!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna: "Sin" can only be defeated by a summoner and the Final Summoning.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Krugum: But, Lady Yuna, without the fayth--
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: Yuna, we're returning to Besaid.
If things stay like this, everything will be forced onto you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: No one cares about things like there being no fayth.
When it comes to "Sin," it's all about summoners, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: Society is just like that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka: Krugum, are you coming too?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Krugum: I--
--------------------------------------------------End--
Krugum: I will 42+56. to Lady Yuna.
Lady Yuna, please make your decision!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna: I--
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna: I have to meet Tidus.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} What is this person?
What is it?!
--------------------------------------------------End--
クルグム：Chuami－－
--------------------------------------------------End--
チュアミ: What are we waiting for now, 42+153.?!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Kurgum: Chuami!
--------------------------------------------------End--
クルグム: Chuami, that room is--
--------------------------------------------------End--
チュアミ: Shh!
--------------------------------------------------End--
クルグム: Hey, Chuami, eavesdropping isn't right.
--------------------------------------------------End--
チュアミ: What the Grand Summoner and the Great Star talk about--
You're interested too, aren't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--
ティーダ: What does that mean?
--------------------------------------------------End--
ユウナ: Because you have that child.
--------------------------------------------------End--
ティーダ: So, Malphi is one of the 42+189.s.
--------------------------------------------------End--
ユウナ: --I wonder if that's true.
--------------------------------------------------End--
ティーダ: But, Yuna, if you just think about it, you'd understand, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
ユウナ: I can't think.
ティーダ: That's not like you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
ユウナ: Yeah, I seem to have gone a bit strange.
For it to come to this-- Sorry.
--------------------------------------------------End--
ティーダ: As long as you understand.
--------------------------------------------------End--
ユウナ: That's not what I mean.
--------------------------------------------------End--
ユウナ: --Sorry.
I'm not looking at you anymore.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Tidus: --Huh?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna: I... it seems I've fallen for someone.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Tidus: Who is it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna: Someone you don't know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Tidus: Then, let me meet them.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna: --I'm sorry.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami: Krugum, I'm shocked. I'm shocked.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami: That woman is 42+190.talk42+191.42+192.ing at a time like this.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami: Hey, Krugum!
Why are you crying?!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Krugum: Chuami -- I'm sorry.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Krugum: 42+136. likes Yuna-sama.
So, I can't be with Chuami. I'm sorry.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami: What is that?
When did we get into that kind of relationship?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Chuami: I don't understand anything!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Krugum: If 42+85. so, it's fine.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Krugum: Yeah, that's better. Let's break up here.
42+136. We must 42+193.part42+105. now.
--------------------------------------------------End--
チュアミ：Kurgum?
--------------------------------------------------End--
クルグム：Chuami wouldn't understand.
Only summoners would understand.
--------------------------------------------------End--
チュアミ：Oh, you said it.
If you say that, it's over.
--------------------------------------------------End--
クルグム：Sorry.
--------------------------------------------------End--
チュアミ：Do as you please!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} After parting with the summoners, I came to Besaid again.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} With everything that happened, I was confused.
I wasn't thinking properly, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} Probably these people who have defeated the {42+153.'Sin'}.
It's to again {42+153.} pull {42+63.} out.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} No matter how willing I become...
For Kurgum, the {42+194.} is heavy.
--------------------------------------------------End--
ティーダ：That's the feeling.
--------------------------------------------------End--
ルールー：So, you just sauntered back, is that it?
{42+91.} will just.
--------------------------------------------------End--
ティーダ：Yuna's favorite {42+103.}, who do you think it is?
--------------------------------------------------End--
ルールー：Think about it yourself.
--------------------------------------------------End--
ティーダ：Because she says it's a {42+103.} I don't know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
LULUL: Haa.
--------------------------------------------------End--
TIDUS: What?
--------------------------------------------------End--
LULUL: Search, find, and 42+195.clinch it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
TIDUS: But...
LULUL: Pathetic man.
--------------------------------------------------End--
LULUL: I thought you understood Yuna a little better.
--------------------------------------------------End--
TIDUS: I intended to, but...
LULUL: But, indeed.
--------------------------------------------------End--
CHUAMI: More importantly, Sin.
--------------------------------------------------End--
CHUAMI: Those people, even without a destination, are getting their hopes up...
--------------------------------------------------End--
LULUL: What if there is a destination?
--------------------------------------------------End--
CHUAMI: Huh?
--------------------------------------------------End--
LULUL: But then, Sin was resurrected, wasn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
LULUL: It wouldn't be strange for anything else to be resurrected.
--------------------------------------------------End--
CHUAMI: That means--
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} わたしはよくわからなくて ティーダを見た
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Font Italic} その人は 42+196.間にしわを42+146.せて 村長を見つめ－－
そして 42+197.いたように目を見開いた
--------------------------------------------------End--
LULUL: We have to go.
--------------------------------------------------End--
TIDUS: Yeah.
--------------------------------------------------End--
As always, it makes no sense.
--------------------------------------------------End--
But I couldn't ask. What I finally managed to ask was--
--------------------------------------------------End--
I wonder where those people are.
--------------------------------------------------End--
No matter where they are-- I have to go there.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Even though they were abandoned?
--------------------------------------------------End--
I promised. That we'd always be together.
--------------------------------------------------End--
I thought, "Why is he bragging about his relationship now?"
--------------------------------------------------End--
But seeing that person's distressed 42+61., I could only remain silent.
--------------------------------------------------End--
I will defeat 'Sin'.
I will definitely defeat it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
