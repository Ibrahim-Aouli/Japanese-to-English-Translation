{Yuna} 
Master {Seymour}'s establishment, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

You know my power,
yet you seek it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

My son...
...you were grieving, weren't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--

...It's alright.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The beginning of this suffering was that child.
Because it was his fault.
--------------------------------------------------End--

And what corrupted that child...
...was my mistake...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
So that's '{Sin}', then?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yes...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Come, Summoner.
I shall bestow my power upon you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Dark Summon Anima.
--------------------------------------------------End--

With the cursed power of darkness,
please erase the '{Sin}' that child sought.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That is for that child...
...my only atonement...
--------------------------------------------------End--
