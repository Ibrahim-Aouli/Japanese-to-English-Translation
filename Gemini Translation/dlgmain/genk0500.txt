{WINDOW}
Show me armor.
{CHOICE:31}, show me your items.
{CHOICE:32} I'll pass.
--------------------------------------------------End--

………… 
Please come again.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Welcome!
If you don't buy here, you'll go to the back of the line.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's dangerous if you're close to Shipah~?
Do you want to be squashed flat~?
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's dangerous if you touch Shipah~?
You'll get smacked with its tail~, you know?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Did you sing the prayer song~, you know?
A mysterious, mysterious charm~?
--------------------------------------------------End--

When everyone sang together...
Shipah got in a good mood~, you know?
--------------------------------------------------End--

In this vicinity, {Al Bhed2}'s
There is information that a form was sighted.
{NEWPAGE}

Do not neglect vigilance at any time,
And pay utmost attention!
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Al Bhed2}'s eyes are green and have a swirl-like
pattern. If you find them, report!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Targeting summoners, {Al Bhed2} seems to be
lurking around.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Shipaafu is operating as usual.
Please rest assured.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Now that the temple is in chaos, {Crusader} must 42+53.make an effort.
42+53.力しなければいけません
--------------------------------------------------End--

The battle with '{Sin}' seems to be continuing.
Those 42+54.heading north, please be careful.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Riding the Shipaafu is free.
The temple is paying for it, you see.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple always 42+55.supports the lives of the people.
It is something to be grateful for.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They say that {Master Seymor} will 42+57.take Lord {Braska}'s
daughter as his 42+56.bride.
--------------------------------------------------End--

With the strength of the two of them, the temple will forever
prosper.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monk stationed here suddenly disappeared,
I'm 42+58.ing, you see.
{NEWPAGE}

As for the esteemed monastic officials of the temple,
They probably have some 42+59. ideas, though...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I will silently obey the temple.
Defying the temple is unthinkable!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't know what meaning it has, but...
I tried singing a prayer song.
{NEWPAGE}

There's nothing else to do, you know...
It's like a drowning person grasping at straws, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The esteemed monastic officials and summoners,
They will surely do something about it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Are you saying that machine goes against the teachings?
Don't say such unseemly things!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The machines here are permitted by the temple!
Don't lump them together with forbidden machines!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Master's 42+60. has been decided, it's truly 42+61.!
Even my mood brightens, you see.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The 42+60. talk of {Master Seymor} and {Yuna}-sama...
What has become of it?
{NEWPAGE}

The Master vanished from {Bevelle}, or Lord {Yuna} is...
...a rebel. Nothing but unbelievable stories.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When strange rumors are flying around,
one must listen carefully to every story.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That flying ship, I thought it was the temple's 切り42+62.
I thought... but...
{NEWPAGE}

They say it's {Al Bhed} who are on board.
That rumor is spreading.
{NEWPAGE}

Have the temple and {Al Bhed} joined forces?
That is truly an unbelievable story.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't believe in the temple or anything anymore.
I only pray that 『{Sin} 』 vanishes soon.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
Ten years ago...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Oh, an old story?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
{Jecht} also, here...
...saw a Shipāfu for the first time.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
A surprised {Jecht} suddenly
slashed at the Shipāfu.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
W-Why!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
was 42+63.ing.
It seems they thought it was a monster.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
It can't be helped, I suppose...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
All the money we had...
We gave it all and apologized.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
And {Jecht}...
Ever since, he quit drinking.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
The Shipahfu from that time...
It still seems to be active now.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
Even after 10 years, {Spira}...
...hasn't changed at all.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
However...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
This place, changing...
...is a world that [resists] it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
So easily...
...it likely won't change.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
Don't be deceived by the peaceful scenery.
Always be ready to fight.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Shipahfu user.
Ride the Shipahfu?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Shipahfu user.
I'm waiting...?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Shipahfu user.
So, get on...?
--------------------------------------------------End--
