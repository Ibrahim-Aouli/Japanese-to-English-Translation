Let me on!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Shiparf is resting, I see.
Will you wait until it's well?
--------------------------------------------------End--

You destroyed {Al Bhed2}'s machine, I hear.
That's a good mindset. It has a quality of {Yevon2}.
{NEWPAGE}

So that {Al Bhed} can't do as they please anymore.
It's necessary to strengthen the store's equipment.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Al Bhed2}, with goggles, the green hue...
...is hidden. They are people who like petty tricks.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The 42+53. taken by '{Sin}', and...
...I met them for the first time in 5 years.
{NEWPAGE}

Speaking of {Guadosalam}...
What a surprising place.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I was able to meet 42+53., so I have no regrets.
I'm ready for the call to {Farplane} to come anytime.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I met the dead 42+53. in {Farplane}, and now nothing...
...to regret, I thought.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's truly a happy ending.
It's worth living a long life, even in a world like this.
--------------------------------------------------End--

On this shore, suspicious-looking...
...42+56. people, I thought there were none...
{NEWPAGE}

I got caught by that man over there.
I ended up buying things.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Compared to other 42+56. people, it's a better 42+57., but...
That person looks suspicious.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone looks happy 42+58., but...
Did something happen?
{NEWPAGE}

Even though 『{Sin} 』 might come at any moment...
I wonder if they're being too carefree.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone wants to forget their anxiety about 『{Sin} 』...
They get engrossed in a little 42+59.i 42+60., you see.
--------------------------------------------------End--

These days, even {Al Bhed2} has been quiet, but...
It's best to be cautious.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple is in chaos because of {Al Bhed2}'s...
...42+61.42+62., isn't it, I wonder?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The one fighting against 『{Sin} 』 is...
...{Al Bhed2}'s ship, right?
{NEWPAGE}

Earning 42+63. credit, toward {Yevon2} Temple...
...they surely intend to curry favor!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if {Al Bhed2} does good things...
...I can't trust them that 42+64.easily.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Together with 42+65., from {Bevelle}...
I ran away.
{NEWPAGE}

If I lived in the main temple of {Yevon2}, the '{Sin}'s
I thought I could forget my fear, but...
{NEWPAGE}

It was a disappointment.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Getting this far was all I could do.
I don't have the energy to go on.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If I could ride an airship, up to 42+67.42+68.
I could return in one flight, couldn't I?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Getting this far was all I could do.
I don't have the energy to go on.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To the {Kilika} of 42+67.42+68....
We are thinking of returning.
{NEWPAGE}

Crossing {Moonflow}, {Djose} and {Mushroom Rock Road}.
Passing through {Mi'ihen Highroad} at {S.S. Winno}...
{NEWPAGE}

*Sigh*... The road to 42+67.42+68. is long, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

When will we be able to return to 42+67.42+68.?
I wonder when we will be able to return...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I quickly took out {Bevelle} 42+69.
I saved my life.
{NEWPAGE}

If I had dawdled, by now the '{Sin}'s...
I might have been pinned underneath.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This area might also become a battlefield...
Should I run further away?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
Don't take your eyes off {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Shipahfu user.
Ride the Shipahfu?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Shipahfu user.
I'll be waiting, okay?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Shipahfu user.
So, get on...?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
{O'aka}, please!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just show me {CHOICE:30}.
