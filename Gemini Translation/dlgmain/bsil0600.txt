{Wakka} 
I was born there,
and started Blitzball at age 5.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
I joined {Besaid Aurochs} at age 13...
I'm what you'd call a 10-year player.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
But even after 10 years,
I couldn't win a single match in the tournaments.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
So, thinking the timing of my retirement was crucial,
I retired after this year's tournament.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
It's an old custom, you see. When leaving the island,
at this ruin, we pray for mu42+53. before we go.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
It brings quite a bit of go ri42+54., you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Want to take a good look?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Let's go quickly!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Wait for a little while.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Huh?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Is it... okay now?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Yes.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Wh-What?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
That day, {Chappu} didn't pray.
Saying he wouldn't make the ship in time.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Alright, perfect!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
The pier isn't this way, is it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
What are you doing in a place like this?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
Monsters are around.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
Protecting the village is {Crusader}'s job, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
Even if defeating '{Sin}' is impossible...
I can do at least that much.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
We'll take care of it.
We're thinking of a good plan.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
In that case, you should go and pray to that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
Everyone who leaves the island, over there...
...they pray for a safe journey.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
{Gatta}... doesn't pray, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Well then, I won't.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
That kind of strange superstition.
...I want to change it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
So I won't pray, and...
I'll defeat '{Sin}' too!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
Without that much confidence...
...it probably won't do, I suppose.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
...Please.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
Even if excommunicated by the temple.
{Crusader}'s mission will not change.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
To protect people from monsters.
That is all.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
To think {Yuna}-chan is a rebel...
That's their mistake.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
The idea that {Yuna}-chan is a rebel...
It seems it was a mistake after all.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
{Besaid}... but everyone...
...was thinking something was wrong.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
As long as '{Sin}' is here,
{Crusader}'s mission will not end.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
It seems the flying ship has
cornered '__P0__'.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
However, the opponent is '{Sin}'.
We cannot let our guard down until the very end.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
For now, we can only pray that those on the flying ship
defeat '{Sin}'.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
Pray.
Do nothing.
