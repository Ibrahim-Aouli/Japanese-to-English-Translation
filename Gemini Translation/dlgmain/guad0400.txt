This player cannot be dropped.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It is {Guado2} who bears the mission to protect {Farplane}.
The most excellent, chosen people in {Spira}.
{NEWPAGE}

Mere numerous humans, or those who are just bodies...
The quality is different, the quality.
{NEWPAGE}

However, that is a story of the past. Today's {Guado}...
...values friendship with other races.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Humans and {Ronso} alike, without discrimination,
let us interact.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord {Jyscal} has appeared, you say?
Hahahaha, please forgive me!
{NEWPAGE}

Entrusting the rest to Lord {Seymour},
they passed away peacefully.
{NEWPAGE}

Such a thing as a reason to return from {Farplane}...
...does not exist.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Guado} will manage the matters of {Farplane}.
Unnecessary interference is not needed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord {Jyscal} might have returned
wanting to see the appearance of the person who will become your son's bride.
{NEWPAGE}

Even a person who ascended to become the elder master of {Yevon2}...
...their behavior is no different from common people.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We must not overlook that matter [42+64, 42+65, 42+66].
That would spoil the joyous celebration [42+67].
--------------------------------------------------End--

The sorrow [42+68] of {Guado} is that the one with human blood mixed in...
...may be the recompense for making them chief.
{NEWPAGE}

All [42+69, 42+70] lies with {Seymour} alone.
That's how it is.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lately, {Tromell} has been shut away in {Farplane}.
They are not in a state to have a proper conversation.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Distinguishing {Guado2} is...
...difficult, isn't it?
{NEWPAGE}

To humans, everyone looks the same [42+60]...
...it seems.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Actually, even we {Guado}...
...are not good at distinguishing humans.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My [42+71]...
...died a long time ago.
{NEWPAGE}

But I can always meet them in {Farplane}.
When I'm in trouble, I often go to meet them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Being able to meet a dead person anytime...
...don't you think it's a wonderful thing?
--------------------------------------------------End--

When will we be pursued by {Al Bhed2}?
Since we don't know, be careful.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Protect Lord {Yuna} properly.
Because they are the one who will become the chieftain of {Guado}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even though I prayed a lot at {Farplane}.
I couldn't meet Lord {Seymour}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Anyone is fine, so quickly choose a new chieftain,
and I want them to restore {Guado}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sometimes, I want to leave {Guado Glories}
and try playing on another team.
--------------------------------------------------End--

As long as I get paid, I
don't mind teaming up with {Al Bhed2}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We always
practice Blitz at __P0__.
{NEWPAGE}

The other day, during practice, Shipalf
happened to pass by and we were almost crushed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To train our reflexes, at {Thunder Plains}
we also train to dodge lightning strikes.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It is certain that many lives
vanished into {Farplane} because of Lord {Farplane}.
{NEWPAGE}

But until recently, I...
...was very much 42+75.42+76.-ing that person.
{NEWPAGE}

42+77. As if suddenly changing my mind, 惠口...
...I think saying that is not manly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It might be foolish pride, but...
Now, I have nothing left to protect but my pride.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're {Besaid Aurochs}'s...
...{Tidus}, aren't you?
{NEWPAGE}

I've been paying attention to you since seeing you at the tournament.
42+78. Let's play together.
--------------------------------------------------End--

During the tournament, it was tough because of the monster 42+65.activity, wasn't it?
Our team also had injured people, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Aren't you going to {Macalania}?
You shouldn't make the other person wait too long.
{NEWPAGE}

Lord {Seymour} doesn't say anything, but...
...I think {Tromell} will get angry.
--------------------------------------------------End--

After the 42+67. ceremony is over, please come again.
I want to get 42+79.riagaritai talking about Blitz.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Our captain is aiming for the next clan chief's...
...seat.
{NEWPAGE}

They say he's shouldering {Guado2}'s future.
I wonder how serious he really is.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If a Blitz player became a tribal chief...
I wonder if {Guado} would change even a little.
