{Lulu} 
It's fine, but... leave me alone.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
I'll bring good news.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tromell} 
Alas, poor Lord {Seymour}.
Where could they be wandering...?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tromell} 
{Jyscal}, please, forgive me.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tromell} 
Even if '{Sin}' vanishes completely.
Without a chieftain, there is no tomorrow for {Guado}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Summoner... properly, the fallen...
...thanks to them commemorating them at '{Farplane}'....
{NEWPAGE}

With my son who died in the operation,
I was able to meet again.
{NEWPAGE}

I don't know who it is, but...
I can't thank them enough.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The reason my son didn't turn into a monster is...
...it's thanks to the Summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This child at '{Operation Mi'ihen}'
...lost his life, you see.
{NEWPAGE}

Even though I tried to stop him, telling him "Don't go!"
...he just rushed out and went...
--------------------------------------------------End--

To die before his parents...
What a terrible child...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Who do you think those two are?
They are not this child's parents, you see.
{NEWPAGE}

Actually... that person died several decades ago.
He is my father, you see.
{NEWPAGE}

My father died a heroic death, but I...
I lived a long life and was blessed with 42+53.
{NEWPAGE}

Perhaps... from my departed father in {Farplane}.
Must have protected me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To grow older than a certain degree
Is indeed 42+54.42+55.
--------------------------------------------------End--

These people, my daddy and
mommy, they are exactly alike.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, hey, why don't these people
Answer me?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even though you were studying 42+56.42+57. to become a monk official...
You must have had so many regrets...
{NEWPAGE}

The day you would become a splendid monk official...
I was looking forward to it so much...
--------------------------------------------------End--

For now, you should rest peacefully in {Farplane}.
We will come soon too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Next time you are reborn,
Choose a place where '{Sin}' is not.
{NEWPAGE}

You must not be born in {Spira}
Anymore...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Those who are born in {Spira}
Everyone is destined to sink into sorrow.
--------------------------------------------------End--
