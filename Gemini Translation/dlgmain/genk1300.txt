Even Master P0, who possesses a splendid record...
The shop will surely prosper thanks to P0!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard you were attacked by P0...
Are you injured?
--------------------------------------------------End--

While I am alive, Master P0's...
I wish to witness Master P0's Nagi-sari.
--------------------------------------------------End--

At P0, to Master P1...
How about meeting Master P1 at P0?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thanks to the Master Summoner's presence...
Even the 42+53.fear of '{Sin}' will be lessened!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I was able to meet Master P0...
I have a good souvenir story to tell, indeed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To think that Master P0 got married (42+54.)!
This is truly the best souvenir story!
--------------------------------------------------End--

You know there's a Shipahuf to ride, don't you?
I'm not good with that.
{NEWPAGE}

Even if the temple has given its permission...
A machine is a machine.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even with a machine that has the temple's permission...
Anyway, it makes me feel 42+55.sick, it's no good.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My grandma, too, when she was [42+56]...
she was a beauty who wouldn't lose to {Yuna}-sama.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you go to [42+57], will {Yuna}-sama with "{Sin}"...
stop the fight, I wonder?
{NEWPAGE}

Only that worries me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If I travel alone, I'm scared I might be captured by {Al Bhed}.
(This line is a continuation of 6 and should not be numbered separately, but since the input gives 7 as a separate line, I will treat it as such. However, grammatically it completes line 6.)
--------------------------------------------------End--

The temple should more [42+58]ly discipline {Al Bhed}, I think!
(This line is a continuation of 8 and should not be numbered separately, but since the input gives 9 as a separate line, I will treat it as such. However, grammatically it completes line 8.)
--------------------------------------------------End--

Did you see {Crusader} returning [42+59][42+60]?
They're tattered and miserable, aren't they...?
{NEWPAGE}

When they passed through here heading to the operation...
everyone was full of confidence then.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Since Master Roshi is [42+54]-ing...
it must be a very [42+61] ceremony.
{NEWPAGE}

Such cheerful news is [42+62], right?
Even I'm getting excited.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Is that person {Yuna}-sama?
Hmm... I see.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If it's someone of {Yuna}-sama's caliber, then {Al Bhed2}...
It's no wonder they'd aim for it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It looks like I'll be busy with the wedding preparations.
I can't afford to be idle.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Guard-san, until the wedding day,
Please protect Lord {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've paid my respects at {Farplane} and said I'll be
heading over there soon.
{NEWPAGE}

Now, even if I'm defeated by '{Sin}',
there's nothing to worry about.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Guado2} had a 42+64.gloomy42+65. look on their face.
Did something happen?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thanks to the song of prayer, my heart found peace.
Now I can go to {Farplane} with peace of mind.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Guado2} had a 42+64.gloomy42+65. look on their face.
Did something happen?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even though the people of {Spira} are panicking,
only the Hypero Tribe remains calm.
{NEWPAGE}

How 42+66.audacious...
They are admirable people.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If Lord {Yunalesca} were alive in this era,
It would be nice not to [42+53.] 『{Sin} 』.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Using an ancient machine, against 『{Sin} 』...
Who could be fighting?
{NEWPAGE}

Could it be that Lord {Yunalesca} from 1000 years ago...
...has revived?
--------------------------------------------------End--

With song and machines, they [42+67.] 『{Sin} 』.
All that's left is for Lord Summoner to deliver the finishing blow!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
I won't be able to move for a while, it seems.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
There might still be {Al Bhed}.
Let's be careful.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kimahri} 
{Kimahri} was careless on the Shipah.
I will never be careless again.
