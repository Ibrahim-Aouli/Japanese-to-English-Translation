{Sin}, cornered by the Great Summoner,
is said to have torn the earth with its last strength.

The wounded Great Summoner and {Sin}
killed each other at the bottom of the valley, and Nagi Shop was established.

The method is simple.
{NEWPAGE}

From where you are to here,
please come within a certain time.
--------------------------------------------------End--

But it's not a trained Chocobo.
It will run wherever it pleases.
{NEWPAGE}

Control that with {Direcional Left} and {Direcional Right},
then pass between me and the Chocobo.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you can't pass between me and the Chocobo,
or if it takes too long, it's no good.
{NEWPAGE}

Also, if it's your first time, after this,
you should listen to {Yellow} [Instructions] {White}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well then, shall we begin?
The target time is {VAR12:35}:{VAR12:34}:{VAR12:33}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well then, shall we begin?
The previous record is {VAR12:35}:{VAR12:34}:{VAR12:33}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

This time, the Chocobo will run straight, but
it's basically the same as the first training.
--------------------------------------------------End--

But! Balls will keep flying, so
use {Direcional Left} and {Direcional Right} to dodge left and right.
{NEWPAGE}

If you collide, the Chocobo will 42+53.stop.
Please try your best not to get hit.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Anyway, if it's your first time,
you should listen to {Yellow} [Instructions] {White} afterwards.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well then, shall we begin?
The target time is {VAR12:35}:{VAR12:34}:{VAR12:33}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well then, shall we begin?
The previous record is {VAR12:35}:{VAR12:34}:{VAR12:33}!

use {Direcional Left} and {Direcional Right} to dodge left and right.

If you collide, the Chocobo will 42+53.stop.

--------------------------------------------------End--

This is {Calm Lands}'s {Macalania Woods} side.
It's right near the exit.
{NEWPAGE}

This is the starting point, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

And the goal, looking from here...
The very right of the plain 42+54.……
{NEWPAGE}

Yes, over in that direction 42+55., right?
--------------------------------------------------End--

To put it simply, it's up to there.
If you arrive faster than me, you win.
{NEWPAGE}

But just arriving quickly isn't enough, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you collect the balloon inside 42+56., your time will get...
...a 342+57. bonus.
{NEWPAGE}

But if you hit a bird like before...
Your Chocobo will stop, and on top of that, you'll get a 342+57. penalty, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To your finishing time, the bonuses and penalties...
The match is decided by the total result of those.
{NEWPAGE}

So, even if you reach the goal later, if you collect many balloons...
...you might still win.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That's enough explanation for now.
Anyway, let's have a match!
{NEWPAGE}

It's only for reference, but...
The time to beat is about {VAR12:35}:{VAR12:34}:{VAR12:33}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

So I'm the challenger, then...
Hmph! Just you watch!!

By the way, the highest record so far is

{Zuke} 
Hmm...

{Wakka} 
What is that?!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Please tell me the 42+59.circumstances.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Zuke} 
Just now, {{Maester Mika2}}
A direct command was issued.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Zuke} 
{{Yuna}} the Summoner and the guard
Assassinated {{Maester Kinoc}} and fled.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Zuke} 
Upon discovery, 42+73.kill them!
...It's a 42+74.42+75.sentence.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
Any other information on {{Bevelle}}'s 42+76.situation?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Zuke} 
On the surface, it's calm, but...
Things are stirring beneath the surface.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Zuke} 
And on top of {Maester Kinoc} dying,
{Master Kelk Ronso} resigned.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
How convenient.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
If {Yevon2} is thrown into disarray,
It makes things that much easier to move.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Zuke} 
But be cautious.
Now, we are {Yevon2}'s enemies.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Zuke} 
It's better not to approach the temple.
That's wise.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Thank you for the advice.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Sensei, just to tell me that,
you came all the way here?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Zuke} 
We are guarding.
What kind of person the Summoner is...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Zuke} 
I was somewhat curious, you see.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Zuke} 
I hope you can make it to the very end this time.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Zuke} 
Above all, it's for your own sake.
--------------------------------------------------End--

...Yes, Sensei.

Well then, I'll take my leave.
I pray for 無42+59.

The person who was a summoner until half a year ago.
{Wakka} and I were the teacher's guards.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Well, it was a 42+81. journey, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I traveled with Teacher {Zuke}...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
See, I talked about it sometime, didn't I?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
I was concerned about Blitz.
He said he couldn't focus on guarding.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
That's why the teacher said he would quit traveling.
When he said that...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Honestly, I felt relieved.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Soon, {Blue} 【{Zanarkand} 】{White} ?
Time... there isn't any, is there?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Remember the gen42+70.

I don't think {Mika} would approve.

{Spira} will also be 42+86.-ed.

Don't try to forcefully get through 42+90.
If it's tough, just complain.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Complain, huh...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I might end up saying it eventually.

Yes.

The chocobos around here...
Once you find them, you can ride them yourself.
--------------------------------------------------End--

But most chocobos...
are wild, so you can't ride them.

Wild chocobos have no reins.
You can tell them apart that way.

Because of the war, there's absolutely nothing.
It became a barren field.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen}

took notice of it.

--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Perfect for the final battle with 『{Sin}』.
That's how it is, then.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
The summoner who acquired the Ultimate Summoning...
They apparently waited for 『{Sin}』 here.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
What kind of feelings...?
Must they have had...?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Anyway, 『{Sin}』 fell in this land...
It is at {Spira} that the Nagi Shop can be traversed, you see.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Therefore, this place is {Calm Lands}.
It's a name someone 42+96. thoughtlessly gave, you see.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Roughly... that's about it, I guess.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Oh, I shouldn't, I shouldn't!
I almost forgot to mention it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
In this plain, there is indeed a 42+97.i
crack in the earth, you see.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
400 years ago, Lord {High Summoner Gandof}...
It's the trace of the time they fought 『{Sin}』, you see.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
May I speak one more 42+61.?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Careless for a rebel.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you carelessly speak to others,
You might be 42+96.discovered by the temple's pursuers.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
If you can 42+96.do it, then 42+96.try.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you have the 42+96.will,
I won't give 42+98.warnings.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Rest assured. The temple's teachings...
They no longer concern me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just like that guard over there.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
Hmph.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
Who are you?
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Belgemine}  
A Summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
However, the journey to defeat 『{Sin} 』...
I gave up on it long ago.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
What I can do now is for a 42+99.Summoner's
training, only to lend strength.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
How about it, {Yuna}?
Shall I lend you my strength for your training?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
If you are willing,
Why don't you try fighting me with your summoned beast?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
Oh, it's you all.
You're completely rebels now.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
What does it matter?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
What? The old masters'...
Just ignore their nonsense.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
For a Summoner, defeating 『{Sin} 』 is everything.
You are not a tool to obey the temple. Understood?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
...Yes.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
Well? Can you defeat 『{Sin} 』?
Have you gained confidence?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
You won't know.
But... I'll do it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
That's good resolve, but with just that...
You won't be able to defeat 『{Sin} 』.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
Let me see your power.
Let's fight with summoned beasts.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
No time to fight with me?
Well, I understand the feeling.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
Well? Shall we spar?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
All right.
Then, before we spar...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
I've healed your summoned beast.
Come at me.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
Impressive.
That's skill typical of 泰42+100.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
Even if you become a rebel, with 『{Sin} 』...
You at least have the will to fight.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
Take this. It is from me, 42+101.42+102.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Thank you very much.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
I'm sure you can do it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
But if you still think you are not strong enough,
Seek the hidden temple, Remium.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
I will wait there.
Farewell.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
What's wrong? With such skill,
You can't defeat '{Sin}'.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
You still need to polish your skills.
It seems necessary.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
The hidden temple, Remium.
I will wait there.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
If you come, I will assist your training.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Oh, thank you very much!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
Strive hard.
Farewell.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This valley is... the claw marks of {Sin}.
{NEWPAGE}

{Sin}, cornered by the Great Summoner,
is said to have torn the earth with its last strength.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The wounded Great Summoner and {Sin}
killed each other at the bottom of the valley, and Nagi Shop was established.
--------------------------------------------------End--

In {Calm Lands}, the remains of the dead...
...we bury in this valley.
{NEWPAGE}

Even if we wish to properly {Farplane} 42+103. them,
Summoners rarely come here...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The unmourned dead became monsters,
and are said to be wandering the valley floor.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's a message from Chief {Cid}.
{NEWPAGE}

{airship} is undergoing repairs.
Once repairs are complete, I will come for you.
{NEWPAGE}

Until then, properly protect {Yuna}.
If you fail, I won't forgive you.
{NEWPAGE}

...he said.
I certainly delivered the message.
--------------------------------------------------End--

After we separated from you all at {Bevelle},
{airship} landed here.
{NEWPAGE}

And after disembarking the {summoner}s,
we headed for repairs.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even though {Bevelle} is near,
there is no temple on this plain.
{NEWPAGE}

Because it is a desolate land, the Reverend
doesn't want to come here.
{NEWPAGE}

Even though people live even in such lands...
What a heartless thing...
--------------------------------------------------End--

But even without a temple,
We aren't so lost.
{NEWPAGE}

In your heart, sincerely
it's fine if you pray.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even without temples,
we are not lost.
--------------------------------------------------End--

In my clan, there is a custom passed down from ancient times,
a custom.
{NEWPAGE}

No matter what happens, without moving from here,
continue to watch... so it says.
{NEWPAGE}

However, exactly what we are watching,
is not known.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't know what this watch is for, but
a custom is a custom.
{NEWPAGE}

I have no intention of moving from here.
{NEWPAGE}

...Well, if even a rare {TAGS}incident
happens, that's another matter.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Looking down at the valley floor for many years,
I've certainly grown bored.
{NEWPAGE}

A little {TAGS}diversion...
If only it were possible...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Forgetting their 42+106. duty among the 42+71.々.
I enjoyed it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've broken the custom, but...
Well, it should be fine for once.
{NEWPAGE}

Well then...
I suppose I'll continue the 42+106..
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're quite capable!
You actually defeated that person.
{NEWPAGE}

Because it was an amazing match,
I couldn't help but come to watch.
{NEWPAGE}

But... that person, when they're strong...
They're strong, but when they're weak, they're weak.
--------------------------------------------------End--

......Huh? If I'm here...
The valley's 42+106. duty...
{NEWPAGE}

Well... I suppose it's fine.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To travel these plains on 42+107. foot...
They're quite remarkable people.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yes, walking isn't easy either, is it?
If you fight monsters, you can become stronger.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hmm... the Chocobos of these plains...
They're mostly feral.
{NEWPAGE}

You have to catch and train them,
or they won't run properly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even the chocobo I'm training now is still not accustomed to people,
so I can't lend it to you.
{NEWPAGE}

It might be faster to give up on chocobos and walk.
It might be faster, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Come back [42+61]. By then,
I might be able to let you ride one.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's easy to say, but
it's actually quite difficult.
{NEWPAGE}

Is that still alright?
--------------------------------------------------End--

What's wrong?
Do you want to ride a chocobo?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Alright.
Then, come over here.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sorry, actually,
it's still being adjusted.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's in quite good condition, isn't it?
Please take good care of it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

So? Want to try training?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Are the chocobos around here wild?
They need training for people to ride them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Right now, there's a trained chocobo available...
...want to try riding it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Did you get lost? If you want to go to {Bevelle}...
...follow me!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Anyway, it's a vast plain.
Don't push yourself and collapse.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Riding a chocobo to avoid monsters...
...that's what a wise traveler does.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The chocobos on the plains have become wild.
Only a small fraction of them can be ridden by people.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Chocobos that will carry people are...
...only the ones with 手42+92. on them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Chocobos belong to no one.
You can ride them as much as you like.
