Gathering information for travelers is also the subjugation squad's job.
It's unassuming, but it's important.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That boy from the subjugation squad is working hard by himself.
That's impressive. Should I try inviting him to the monk-soldier army?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The operation will start soon.
We need to depart quickly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've set up this monitor to show information on monsters around {Luca}.
(Continuing from 7)
--------------------------------------------------End--

Once you leave town, it's a long, long {Blue} 【{Mi'ihen Highroad} 】{White}.
Monsters also appear, so you can't let your guard down on the way.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you gather information with the Sphere Monitor,
I think your journey will become a bit easier.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Travelers check monster information on this monitor
before departing.
{NEWPAGE}

Gathering information for travelers is also
our {Crusader}'s job.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Prayer songs are my specialty!
Everyone sang along with my trumpet!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please enjoy the wonderful music!
You want to see the beautiful 42+53.image, don't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear the footsteps of the approaching Nagi 42+54.
Then, perhaps I shall perform mae 42+55.i.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If we talk, it will be a long story.
How about listening to the datsumei at 42+56.?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Did Fune and 'Shin' fly over again?
Then, I'll sing with my drum.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do you want to hear our music?
Let's buy spheres over there.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The drummer looks like us~.
A giant relative of the Hypero Tribe?
--------------------------------------------------End--

This isn't a stadium, is it~?
We might be lost, it seems~?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
Hey, boy!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
You were in jail, weren't you!?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
Hard-headed monk officials like them...
They're an easy thing.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
By making a deal,
I got out!
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Sorry. About us...
It's probably why you got involved.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
It's fine.
Because you're a valued customer.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
...Well, you see...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
I had a younger sister.
To {Wantz}, she'd be an older sister.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
She was a summoner.
Even though she was still 42+57., she went on a journey...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
That was the last of it.
--------------------------------------------------End--


--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
Both I and {Wantz} are completely useless at fighting.
We couldn't become guards.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
That I couldn't help her at all...
It was so frustrating, so frustrating...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
That's why, at least, other summoners...
I want to help them.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
Besides, {Yuna}-sama is oddly like my sister...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Huh?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
It's nothing.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Thanks.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
Alright.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
The important 42+58. is with {Wantz}.
The 23rd generation ended up 42+59..
