There are an excessive number of guards, and...
And you even have Lord {Auron} on your side.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
And furthermore, to Lord {Seymour} as well...

--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
Oh, that's quite splendid.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona}

{Dona}

--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}

--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna}

am just traveling.
