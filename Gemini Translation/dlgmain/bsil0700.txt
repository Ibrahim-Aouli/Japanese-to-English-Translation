{Tidus} 
That's an excuse, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
That's tough, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
And then, after retiring...
You started a new job, didn't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
But if I let my guard down a little...
I immediately end up thinking about Blitz.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Ten years without a win, you know...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Shop Year's first round was a chance.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
But something tough happened...
I couldn't concentrate on the match.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
I want to win the next tournament and feel refreshed.
Is that it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
What's your goal for the tournament?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Rank doesn't matter.
If I can have a good match, that's enough.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
If you're asked, 'Goal?'
Answer, 'Go Win!'
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
If you're going to enter the match, win.
What else is there?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Go Win... seriously?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
If I put my all into it and feel fulfilled,
I think I can quit cleanly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh, someone from the sea?
--------------------------------------------------End--

This path has many monsters, so...
You should be careful.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You got close to 『{Sin} 』 and still survived, didn't you?
Don't get defeated in a place like this!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Who?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
{Luzzu} and {Gatta} of {Crusader}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Hm?
Punitive Force?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
You... even something like that...
Have you forgotten?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
I'm glad.
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Understood.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
In return, during the tournament...
I'll give it my all, and {42+53.}!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Understood.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Ask about {Crusader} directly.
Should be in the village quarters.
--------------------------------------------------End--
