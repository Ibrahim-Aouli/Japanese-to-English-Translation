Are you alright!?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Someone!!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Amazing...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Hey! Hello!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Y-You...
Do that move from before again?
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Font Italic} I was glad.
I really thought I was saved just now{Font Normal}
--------------------------------------------------End--

Amazing... Whoa...
Oh... Amazing...
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're no amateur.
Which team are you from?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
{Zanarkand Abes} ！
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Zanarkand}? What did you say?
   {Zanarkand Abes} ……
--------------------------------------------------End--

…Where did you come from?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Hey! Scratch that!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
I got too close to 『{Sin} 』...
My head's spinning, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
So, where I came from, or...
where this place is...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Was I affected by 『{Sin} 』's toxic fumes...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

But I'm alive like this.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's a blessing from {Yevon2}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Keep training.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I am {Wakka}.
I am the coach of this {Besaid Aurochs} player shop.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Oh, just hungry?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Alright! Let's go to the village.
I'll get you something to eat.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I thought {Font Italic} {Wakka} was a good person.
So... I wanted to ask, {Font Normal}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Long, long ago, {Spira} had many huge cities.
Even at night, they were bustling, mechanical metropolises.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Everyone relied on the power of machines,
and were living enjoyable lives, you see.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
But... look.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
`{Sin}` appeared and...
destroyed the entire mechanical city.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Of course, `{Zanarkand}` as well.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
That was roughly 1000 years ago...
Yes, just as you said.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Well, `{Sin}` got carried away.
So, it was a [42+53.] toward humans.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Good grief...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Because of those people from the past, that we in the present...
...have to suffer [42+54.]... it really makes me [42+55.] angry, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Of course, atoning for the sin...
...is the important [42+56.] of present-day humans.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
I know that, yeah.
But sometimes I just can't bear it anymore...
--------------------------------------------------End--

It was just as `{Font Italic}` `{Rikku}` said, `{Font Normal}`.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Both `{Font Italic}` `{Wakka}` and `{Rikku}` lie.
There's no need at all, `{Font Normal}`.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Hahaha! But still.
That `{Zanarkand Abes}`, I've [42+57.] it!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Perhaps such a team.
It might have really happened, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Font Italic} encourages me.
Wakka's feelings made me happy.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Font Italic} But what I was thinking at that time was...
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Font Italic} The beginning is '{Sin}'.
So, if I meet one more line of '{Sin},'...
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Font Italic} If I can do that, to {Zanarkand}...
...might be able to reach.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Font Italic} Until that time comes, things like where this is or...
...what era it is, let's stop caring about it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Font Italic} It was difficult not to care, but...
...I felt a little relieved.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Font Italic} Just... a little.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto.
When the ball falls...
...I just end up closing my eyes.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto.
You're being affected by the poison, right?
You should rest soon.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto.
Oh, right! Here, take this.
It might even work on poison.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto.
The reason you didn't drown is...
...because you're a Blitz player... probably.
{NEWPAGE}
Datto.
Top-tier players, even if they hold their breath the whole time...
...don't struggle at all, right?
{NEWPAGE}
Datto.
We want to learn from that too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto.
From the shore to 42+59., how many 42+60.rounds without breathing...
...we've tried to see how many we could do.
{NEWPAGE}
Datto.
For us, 2 42+60.rounds is our best, but...
Mr./Ms. {Wakka} can do 5 42+60.rounds easily!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Reti!
I'm good at heading!
I'm not in good form today, though...
--------------------------------------------------End--
Reti!
That's strange...
I was able to do it 5 times in a row 42+66.that day, yet...
--------------------------------------------------End--
Reti!
I lose to Mr./Ms. {Wakka}, but...
I'm confident in 42+67.water!
{NEWPAGE}
Reti!
As for those fun-ball skills,
I'm just a little weak with them, though...
--------------------------------------------------End--
Reti!
Top-tier players, even if they 42+68.42+69. in water,
don't drown, is that true?
{NEWPAGE}
Reti!
If they reach that level, they're monsters, aren't they?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Jash
That shot was amazing~
I want to try shooting something like that too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Jash
{Wakka} is waiting.
Wouldn't it be better to go quickly?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Jash
Monsters will appear on the path to the village.
If it gets dangerous, use this.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Bots
At this year's tournament, {Wakka}-'s
I must make sure not to be a hindrance.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Bots
Once your malice is gone,
please practice with me.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Bots
I hope the bad mood clears quickly.
--------------------------------------------------End--
KIPPA
As you can see, our team...
...we're just a little bit [42+70.] on the lower side, you see.
--------------------------------------------------End--
KIPPA
Our [42+71.] is 'We'll try our best!'
That's all we have going for us, though...
--------------------------------------------------End--
KIPPA
You too, with this...
...try your best too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
KIPPA
Our team, right after the match starts...
...we're in good form, but...
{NEWPAGE}
KIPPA
Everyone, during [42+72.], becomes breathless...
...and we get defeated during that opening.
{NEWPAGE}
KIPPA
But {Wakka} is different.
That person's training is different.
{NEWPAGE}
KIPPA
Not even until halftime, but until the end of the match.
They've stayed submerged the whole time, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Well, teams from an era when they lived a life of ease...
They're bound to be weak, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
There's no need for you to get down!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Um, about {Zanarkand}...
It was destroyed 1000 years ago... wasn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Now it has turned into ruins.
...That's right, isn't it?
