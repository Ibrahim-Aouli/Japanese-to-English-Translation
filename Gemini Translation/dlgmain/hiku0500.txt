{Kimahri} 
{Kimahri} is {Al Bhed}'s.
I won't forget the line of stores.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kimahri} 
If {Yuna} is found.
Even forbidden machines don't matter.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kimahri} 
As for {Yuna}...
{Yuna} should decide.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kimahri} 
{Yuna} was deeply troubled.
I am worried about {Kimahri}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kimahri} 
You just look forward and go.
{Kimahri} will protect your back.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kimahri} 
Thanks to you.
{Yuna} did not lose courage.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kimahri} 
I express my thanks.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kimahri} 
{Kimahri}'s life is a life saved in return.
I won't treat it lightly.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kimahri} 
{Kimahri}'s preparations are ready.
I can fight '{Sin}' anytime.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kimahri} 
'{Sin}' is alive.
{Kimahri} understands.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kimahri} 
{Ronso} and the others were also singing.
{Kimahri}'s ears definitely heard.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kimahri} 
Inside '{Sin},' just a little...
...there were 42+53.kai thoughts.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kimahri} 
There is nothing to 42+54.
{Kimahri} will go with you to 42+55.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Isaaru} 
To {Al Bhed2}, quite a lot...
...I've become indebted.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Isaaru} 
However... no matter what I'm told.
I cannot stop the journey.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Even though you'll die?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Isaaru} 
I had decided this since my 42+56.hood.
I've been ready for a long time.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Isaaru} 
If 42+57. doesn't do it, who will...?
That's how it is.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Isaaru} 
That something like this flies through the sky...
I can't believe it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Isaaru} 
I think it's an amazing machine, but...
Still, it goes against the teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Isaaru} 
Honestly, when I'm riding it...
I feel better, huh.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
It's just a vehicle42+58.i, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Isaaru} 
A vehicle...42+58.i?
What is that?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Isaaru} 
Once we get off the ship,
we'll resume the journey immediately.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maroda} 
Me too, Aniki at the journey's end...
For him to die, that's not a good feeling.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maroda} 
If there's a way for no one to die,
I'd definitely choose that way.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Well then, let's think!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maroda} 
You just say it so simply, 42+59.tanni...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maroda} 
If only we had plenty of time,
I could think endlessly.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maroda} 
But, while we're thinking slowly,
『{Sin}』 will destroy everything, won't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maroda} 
There's no time for {Spira}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maroda} 
We are at {Besaid} and...
we've been caught by {Al Bhed2}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maroda} 
{Pacce} fell into a trap...
and we had no choice but to obey.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maroda} 
Well, it can't be helped, I guess.
{Pacce} was quite strained too, you see.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maroda} 
Even though they're still a kid, they're pushing themselves.
Coming along on our journey...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maroda} 
They're straining themselves with their small body.
They're quite something, that one.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maroda} 
Hey, this ship...
Where is it heading?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maroda} 
Don't get hurt!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Isaaru} 
Could you let them sleep?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maroda} 
Don't wake them up!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Pacce} 
This place is safe!
We're protecting it!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
Well, well.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
It seems you managed to escape safely.
That is most welcome.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
You were on board too!?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
To procure supplies at home...
Just as I returned, I got caught up in it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
It's a terrible misfortune.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
Fortunately, everything is fine.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
If you need anything.
Please feel free to ask for anything.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30}, show me your weapons.
{CHOICE:31}, show me your items.
{CHOICE:32} I'll pass.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
For our travel company in the future...
Please continue to favor us.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
Upgrades are at the Home's...
I will visit again.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
Welcome.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
Welcome.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
This is the Travel Agency and Airship Head Office.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
Welcome.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
If you need anything, please ask.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
{Yuna},
You've become stronger.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
Within your calm demeanor,
I sense an inner strength.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
You really take after your parents.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
{Yuna}'s father, {Yevon2}'s...
A monk, yet he married a {Al Bhed} person?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
{Braska}, with {Al Bhed},
shared a friendship.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
Because of that, the home at the time...
was often visited.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
So, he met {Cid}'s younger sister?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
Yes, the two of them, practically eloping...
Apparently, they ran off.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Hah... Impressive...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Ah! Old man, you're angry, aren't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
It's because of that nature.
They immediately cut ties, I hear.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
However, since {Yuna} was born,
They ended up reconciling, you see.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
Their younger sister, by herself,
Headed for Home.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
However, that ship...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
……『{Sin} 』？
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
The reason {Braska} became a summoner was
It is said that that 42+62. incident was the catalyst.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Is it all {Sin} 's fault...?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
You will bring it to an end, won't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Ah, I'll defeat them.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
I am praying for your 42+85. battle.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
Finally, it's the decisive battle with {Sin} , isn't it?
Do you need any 42+65.?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Even at a time like this, 42+64.壳?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
Yes, of course.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
After you all defeat {Sin}.
I must rebuild the home.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Greedy, or rather...
...resilient, or rather...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
Speaking of which, the strength of {Al Bhed} language is...
How is it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
I've learned quite a lot!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Hmm...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Nice to meet you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
Even if they repeat the words I taught...
...that doesn't mean you've learned them.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
However, the pronunciation is quite difficult.
You seem to have improved quite a bit.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
If you have any needs in the future...
Please feel free to ask for anything.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Thank you.
Next time too, please.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
Wonderful.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
Our language.
You've learned it perfectly.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
It's easy once you understand the trick.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
To think a day would come when we could speak like this...
It is truly a joyful matter.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Me too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
Please, by all means, accept my celebratory gift.
Please accept it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Thank you!

I'll leave this to you!
I'm not good at fighting.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I miss {Bikanel}'s desert.
Even if it's harsh land, it's my homeland.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't believe {Mika} is a corpse...
I didn't even notice when I saw them in {Luca}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone's song throughout {Spira}...
If it echoes, it'll work out somehow.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, hey, watching 『{Sin}』...
Is it okay not to be there?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do you intend to clash head-on with 『{Sin}』?
You're quite something!
--------------------------------------------------End--

To jump into 『{Sin}』...
I hadn't even dreamed of it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Precisely at a time like this...
Training, training!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone, calm down! Calm yourselves!
You mustn't panic!
--------------------------------------------------End--

『{Sin}』 that close...
It's the first time I've seen it!
--------------------------------------------------End--

When you stay on a ship for a long time, your body gets dull.
I want to work up a sweat at {blitzball}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Finally, it's the decisive battle with 『{Sin}』.
Can I stay calm?!
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's the calm before the storm.
Training, training during this time!
--------------------------------------------------End--

This time for sure, settle it!
I'll leave it to you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When {Calm} comes, we'll have many matches!
Train, train in preparation for that time!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I did something inexcusable concerning {Luca}.
I wanted to protect {summoner}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That the location of {Home} was exposed to {Yevon2}...
...is it because we were followed...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

On the island called {Baaj}, long ago there was a temple...
...but now it is the lair of {fiend}.
{NEWPAGE}

Somewhere in the deserted temple...
...apparently there is an amazing treasure.
{NEWPAGE}

However, a strong {fiend} lives there...
...and seems to be protecting the treasure.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I went to {Baaj} to investigate before.
I heard from my comrades, but...
{NEWPAGE}

When they entered the desolate temple,
a song of prayer could faintly be heard, apparently.
{NEWPAGE}

Perhaps with {aeons},
it might be related, I suppose.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Baaj}'s island has many mysteries.
Why don't you try investigating thoroughly?
--------------------------------------------------End--

You can surely do it.
Believing that, I will sing too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When this battle ends,
it'll be a match in {blitz} again, then.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Since I was a child,
I was dedicated solely to {blitz}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

After resting a bit in {Home},
I was planning to return to {Luca}, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're a rebel, aren't you?
Then you're the same as {Al Bhed}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even though {Yunalesca} and {Mika} died,
they were clinging to {Spira}, weren't they...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm sorry, I'm scared and my body is trembling.
I was very scared before the battle.
--------------------------------------------------End--

But when I was singing, the fear disappeared.
I want this battle to end quickly...
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I was inside '__P0__,'
I was scared, so I kept singing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone in {Sin} is immortal.
They can also participate in matches.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Be careful! {Al Bhed Psyches} are everywhere!
I wonder where __P0__ will head from now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I want to become a first-rate player, so I want to experience various teams.
I'm not flustered, you know!
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's training to endure a pinch!
Leave the ship to __P0__, and you should rest while you can.
--------------------------------------------------End--

いちりゅうの せんしゅに なりたいから
いろんな ちーむを けいけん したいわ
--------------------------------------------------End--

あわてて いるんじゃ ないからね！
ぴんちに たえる くんれんよ！
--------------------------------------------------End--

ふねの ことは {Al Bhed} に まかせて
いまのうちに やすんでおいたら
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's no point in me panicking, but...
I can't stay calm.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Rikku} and {Yuna}.
Please take care of them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone grieving after losing {Home}...
I want to cheer them up with {blitz}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I won't die in a place like this!
{fiend}! If you're coming, then come!
--------------------------------------------------End--

While on {airship}...
Let's train our bodies.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This is the end for the temple, too.
The age of machines will come soon.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Cid} chief's courage is amazing.
I want to learn from that too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because the ship shook violently...
I felt sick.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When the time comes, I'll fight too!
I'll ram a shot into 『{Sin}』.
--------------------------------------------------End--

How was it inside 『{Sin}』?
It seems like {fiend} are swarming.
