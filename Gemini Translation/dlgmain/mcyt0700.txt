When the dream ends, you too will vanish...
Into Spira's sea, into the sky, you will melt away...
--------------------------------------------------End--

But please don't lament...
But please don't be angry...
--------------------------------------------------End--

For we too were once human...
Cannot help but dream...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Let's create a sea in a new dream world...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Let's create a sea for you to join...
--------------------------------------------------End--
