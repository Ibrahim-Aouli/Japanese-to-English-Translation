This player cannot be dropped.

You have come from a distant land.
You must be quite tired.
{NEWPAGE}

Oh, my words...
...seem unfamiliar, don't they?
{NEWPAGE}

This is {Guado2}'s ancient language.
You will rarely hear it in your land.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Now, those who pass down the ancient language...
...have become only a handful of elders.
{NEWPAGE}

Even {Guado}'s traditional language...
...will probably die out eventually.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Many {Guado} are ashamed of their ancient language...
...and speak like other peoples.
--------------------------------------------------End--

In the past, {Guado} did not favor interaction with Humans...
...and did not prefer it.
{NEWPAGE}

However, thanks to the {42+53.る} {改42+54.} by {Jyscal}-sama...
...{Guado} have turned their eyes to the outside world...
{NEWPAGE}

...and have come to keep up with the flow of the times...
...It has become so, [42+55].
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {42+56.子} of {Jyscal}-sama and {Seymour}-sama...
...changed {Guado2}'s traditions.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The young ones who bore {Guado2}'s future have died.
Only the elderly remain.
{NEWPAGE}

{Guado2} should have stayed inside
and protected __P1__.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Having lost Lord {Seymour}, {Tromell} is
completely disheartened.
{NEWPAGE}

Eventually, they will follow after them,
and journey to {Farplane}, I wonder?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Before long, 'The {Sin} ' will come
and destroy {Guado2}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

O Traveler, we are old people left behind by the times.
Please forgive our rudeness for speaking in an old tongue.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Guado2} of old used
such an old tongue.
{NEWPAGE}

However, when the deceased Patriarch {Jyscal} became a venerable teacher,
and {Yevon2}'s teachings spread throughout {Guado}...
{NEWPAGE}

The old tongue gradually faded,
and is now on the verge of extinction.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The young ones regard our language
as old-fashioned and mock it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord/Lady {Seymour}'s 42+69.42+61. was human.
Following that 42+70., some individuals...
{NEWPAGE}

Lord/Lady {Seymour} leading {Guado}
did not wish to accept.
{NEWPAGE}

No 42+71. Nowadays, such opinions
are voiced by no one.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Many of {Guado}'s 42+58. people
have 42+72. their hearts to Lord/Lady {Seymour}.
{NEWPAGE}

If it is Lord/Lady {Seymour}'s command,
they would 42+73.ly go to their deaths.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord/Lady {Seymour} dislikes archaic words 42+64.
We are the revered 42+55. who 42+75. with our 42+74. selves.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord/Lady {Seymour} many individuals
led to their deaths.
{NEWPAGE}

Towards both {Guado} and humans,
it might be 42+77. as well.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The 42+78. between Lord/Lady {Jyscal} and a human woman
was contrary to {Guado2}'s tradition.
{NEWPAGE}

After that 42+70., when Lord/Lady {Seymour} was born,
some individuals instigated a 42+79. commotion...
{NEWPAGE}

"Expel those with human blood," they said.
They made that request.
{NEWPAGE}

As the clan head, {Jyscal}...
Reluctantly, {Baaj Island} expelled their 42+80.child to {Baaj Island}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A few years later, only {Seymour} returned.
The story is that 42+69.42+61. passed away.
{NEWPAGE}

The 婦42+81. {Seymour}...
...had acquired the power of a summoner.
{NEWPAGE}

The 42+62.position of {Seymour}, who had been driven out with stones, reversed...
...and came to be 42+82.42+83.ed as a summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Seymour}, as soon as they came of age...
...the story is that they awakened to their summoner abilities.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Chieftain {Seymour} teaches {Guado}'s 42+58.people...
...many different 42+84.lessons.
{NEWPAGE}

42+85. {Yevon2}'s teachings and {Spira}'s 42+86.42+87.
I 42+88.studied a lot.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Chieftain {Seymour} is skilled at teaching.
They explain everything in an easy-to-understand way.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There are rumors about {Yuna}.
She is the daughter of that {High Summoner Braska}...
{NEWPAGE}

You fought together with Chieftain {Seymour} at the time of {Operation Mi'ihen}, didn't you?
If __P0__-sama comes to O[42+89], everyone in __P0__ will [42+90][42+65].
--------------------------------------------------End--

Um... did something happen to Chieftain {Yuna}?
I heard a bit of a rumor, but I couldn't believe it...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Chieftain {Seymour}... __P1__-sama... No, I don't want to believe it...
The elders do not try to abandon __P0__'s old language.
{NEWPAGE}

I'm saying that using language difficult for guests to understand is rude, but...
Since it is something the [42+59]-aged do, please overlook it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There seems to be an opinion that {Seymour}'s confusion was due to {Jyscal}'s [42+91][42+92].
It's frustrating that I can't [42+71], isn't it...
--------------------------------------------------End--

There was contact from {Guado}. As for __P1__...
捨てようとしないのです
{NEWPAGE}

お客人にわかりにくい言度を使っては
失礼だと 言っているのですが……
--------------------------------------------------End--

年42+59.りのすることですので
どうかお見逃しください
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Spira} が混乱したのは {Guado2} の
42+91.42+92.だという意見があるようです
{NEWPAGE}

反42+71.できないのが くやしいですね……
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Luca} から連絡がありました {Guado2} は
They say we can participate in the tournament as usual.
{NEWPAGE}

{Luca} 42+93. I was saved by the people's generosity.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Play a great match.
I want to give back to the people of {Luca} 42+94.
