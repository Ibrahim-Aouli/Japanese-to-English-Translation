You know, don't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
......The old Capital Shop?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yes, the remnants of the ancient Capital Shop.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Every time I see these, I...
...I truly realize the great power of '{Sin}'.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Compared to that, humans are but...
...They're on the same level as worms.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
However, the ones who can defeat '{Sin}',
I think are only humans.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Good resolve.
I'm relieved, Summoner-sama.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Pardon me, I was slow to respond.
I am called '{Maechen}'.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
{Spira}'s 42+53.42+54.... yes, that's right.
I am traveling to learn its true form.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
For the sake of 42+55.究, I am traveling through 42+56.地, but...
Oh, it is truly lamentable.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Everywhere, people's 42+57.42+58. is a false 42+57.42+58.
If they hear the name of '{Sin}', it swiftly vanishes.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Make the people's 42+57.42+58. real.
I'm counting on you, Summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Yes.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's a statue of {Mi'ihen}-sama.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
It's a statue of {Mi'ihen}-sama.

{Maechen} 
You are 42+65. of the Guard, yes?
Thank you for your efforts.

{Maechen} 
Even on the highway, there are many monsters, you know.
Please be careful.

{Yuna} 
Yes, I am {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Djose} {Crusader}, from the Chocobo Cavalry.
I am {Lucil}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Likewise, I am {Elma}.
I am responsible for the 42+66. of this highway.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
Around here, targeting chocobos...
Large monsters appear.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
Those 42+67. using chocobos...
Please be very careful.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Understood.
Thank you for the 42+68..
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lucil} 
Well then, we...
We have 42+69.42+70., so we will take our leave.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
I pray for the 42+71. of your journey.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Large monsters, huh...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Shall we defeat them?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
Why?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Everyone is 42+72. by them, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
Everyone is 42+72.... huh.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
What is it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
{Jecht} often said the same thing.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
Because of that, {Braska} and I...
...always got dragged into trouble.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh, the Summoner's party, is it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
You're a summoner, too, aren't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm {Belgemine}.
And you?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I respond with '{Yuna}.'
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
Oh, I've heard of 42+73.
That's the Great Summoner's 42+74., isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
That being said, from what I see...
...you still seem like a 42+75. beginner, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Yes, well...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
In that case, shall I 42+76. help you with your training?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
With your summon and my summon,
let's have a 42+77. skill contest.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
It's a one-on-one match.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
Don't worry, I'll go easy.
So, what will you do?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
Well, I won't force you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I'm sorry.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
If you change your mind,
let me know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
I wonder if you've changed your mind?
Will you spar?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I'll try.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
All right.
Well then, before we begin...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
Your summoned beast was healed.
Don't go in far... Come.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
Even though 42+79.i, that's quite something.
I didn't expect it to go this far.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
Keep it. It's a reward.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
Your training is still insufficient.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
But you did well.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
You are good at 42+80.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
If you train tirelessly,
You might be able to achieve 『{Sin}』.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Yes!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
But before me,
It seems you might defeat them first, though...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
I can't do it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
No...
Perhaps I should say I couldn't.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Well then...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Belgemine} 
Goodbye, {Yuna}. We'll meet again someday.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh! Is that Guard?
Protect the Summoner with this.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please use this if you like.
Guard.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This is my gratitude to the Summoner.
Please accept it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Some kind of huge operation is...
...starting, I hear.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't know what they intend to do, but...
{Crusader} is a busybody too, aren't they?
{NEWPAGE}

The fight against '{Sin} '...
...just leave it to the Summoner, they say.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They say {Crusader} can't defeat '{Sin} '.
42+53.42+54. is 42+81. making it clear.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder where they went...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I got separated from 42+82.
We were supposed to meet here! Ugh!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I must return quickly, or...
The operation will start.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Crusader}'s movements are vigorous.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Apparently, {Crusader} from all over Spira...
...are gathering one after another, it seems.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just between us, {Yevon2} Temple also...
...seems to be involved.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The highway's security is for {Guado2}.
Please leave it to me.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Temple should... {Operation Mi'ihen}'s failure...
...be passed down for a long time.
{NEWPAGE}

Such a tragedy must not be repeated.
It must not happen.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The operation's failure is for those who defy the teachings...
...and will be a bitter lesson.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The connecting ship that was out of service...
...seems to have started moving again.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord Mihen's statue has seven...
...legends.
{NEWPAGE}

But all of them...
...are worthless nonsense.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Like it starts walking every night, or...
...its eyeballs move.
{NEWPAGE}

Right? It's nonsense, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's even a story that the sword Lord Mihen used long ago...
...remains.
{NEWPAGE}

Something from that long ago...
There's no way it's still around, huh.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sometimes a large shadow in the sky...
...flies by.
{NEWPAGE}

It's too big for a bird, and...
What could it be?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Could it be...?
No, that's not possible.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder if someone is riding on it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

There are just too many monsters, so...
I can't even take a carefree walk.
--------------------------------------------------End--

At least the highway's 42+66.security,
I wish they'd properly manage.
{NEWPAGE}

If we can pass safely, even if it's {Crusader}...
...or a warrior monk, I don't care.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even so, for a place like this...
...I guess they can't even manage the 42+66.security.
{NEWPAGE}

I guess I have no choice but to protect myself.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It seems like a place where something might be, but...
{NEWPAGE}

No matter how much I search, there's just nothing...
--------------------------------------------------End--

It seems like a place where something might be written, but...
{NEWPAGE}

Well, no matter what was written,
I can't read it myself, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Huh!?
{NEWPAGE}

Just kidding. Still, I...
...can't find anything.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Many people are abandoning {Bevelle} and fleeing.
I hear the temple's enforcement is too strict.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It seems the monk officials...
...seem to only be thinking about the temple's safety.
{NEWPAGE}

If {Maester Mika2} had been alive,
This wouldn't have happened.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The fact that '{Sin}' fell into {Bevelle}...
...it might be a warning to the current temple.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because '{Sin}' fell,
{Bevelle} seems to be in great chaos.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My cousin is a monk soldier from {Bevelle}.
I hope they are safe...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I want someone, anyone, to quickly...
...defeat '__P0__'.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They are walking the same path as Lord Mihen.
{NEWPAGE}

Then {Crusader} will see what they should do.
I think it will become clear.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Crusader} is just for fighting '{Sin}',
You're not just someone meant to fight '__P1__', are you?42+60.
{NEWPAGE}

So that everyone can live with peace of mind42+89.
Let's start with what we can do.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Staying depressed forever...
We can't do that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When we looked up at the flying ship and sang,
we 42+90.got excited, but...
{NEWPAGE}

A calm42+91. hasn't come yet, has it?
I wonder what's happening.
--------------------------------------------------End--

As for {Spira} from now on,
I wonder what will become of them?
{NEWPAGE}

I've been thinking about many things, but...
I become confused.
--------------------------------------------------End--

No matter what I think, in any case...
It will only turn out as it's meant to, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
The place we can go by Chocobo is...
...up to here!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
Alright, alright, get off!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
{Crusader} is for the operation,
undergoing training, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
Only I am in a place like this,
on [42+63] duty, you know...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Clasko} 
After all, someone like me...
the best I can do is [42+63] [42+92]...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hello there!
It's [42+93] this time!
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's [42+93] this time, but...
It seems you're already riding~
{NEWPAGE}

I'll make it [42+93] for you next time~
--------------------------------------------------End--

Would you like to ride a Chocobo~?
--------------------------------------------------End--

How to ride a Chocobo...
Would you like to know?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please take care on your journey.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This is concerning {Crusader}, from hundreds of years ago,
it's the statue of Lord {Mi'ihen} who made it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord {Mi'ihen} passed through this highway,
and went to {St. Bevelle} Palace, I heard.
{NEWPAGE}

Since then, this highway is
...known as {Mi'ihen Highroad} [42+94].
