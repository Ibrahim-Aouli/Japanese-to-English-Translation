{Lulu} 
I admit that child resembles {Chappu}.
I was surprised when I first saw her too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
But no matter how much she resembled her...
She cannot be a substitute for {Chappu}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
You probably don't understand now, but...
I was always right, wasn't I?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
But still...
He was wrong too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Another excuse?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
But...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
But? But?
...I'm tired of hearing it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
I hate it!!
--------------------------------------------------End--

She's already dead!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
That's scary.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
So {Chappu}?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
My answer.
For you... he was by your side.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Died?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
He was in {Crusader}, but...
42+53. Fought against 『{Sin} 』... and was defeated.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
I learned that...
...on the day of the tournament.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Ah... and so...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
I became a guard,
and decided to fight 『{Sin} 』.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Revenge?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
That was the plan, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
42+54. It just happens, doesn't it? And revenge as a response...
Blitz. Which one is more 42+55.?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Well, once the next tournament is over,
I'll focus on being a guard.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
For that purpose, I'm using you.
It seems that way, but... 惠いな
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Don't worry about it. I also...
...am completely relying on you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Having met you,
I've really been helped.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
For many things...
Thank you, {Wakka}
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
I'm getting shy, so stop it!
--------------------------------------------------End--
