{Tidus} 
What is "Otherworld Journey"?
What's starting?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
It's not that you forgot,
it really feels like you don't know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
The dead wander.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Because they're too sad about having died,
they refuse to accept their own death.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
While wishing they could live more,
they envy those who are still alive.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
The dead envy the living.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
That feeling,
eventually turns into jealousy and hatred.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
If such feelings of the dead linger in {Spira},
they become monsters that hate life and prey on people.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Isn't that sad?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
That's why, by performing the "Otherworld Journey",
we put the wandering dead to sleep.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Is that also a Summoner's duty?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
...Being a Summoner is tough.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
{Yuna} chose that.
I was prepared for everything.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
What we can do is...
...only watch over {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Until the very end.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
...The final moment?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
What is "last"!?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Until we defeat '{Sin}'.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I wonder if I did well?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Excellent for a first time.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
I'm sure everyone made it to {Farplane}.
But try not to cry next time.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wish there wouldn't be a next time...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people killed by '{Sin}' ...
{Yuna} who performs 'Otherworld Crossing'...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people who watch over that...
--------------------------------------------------End--

A mysterious... and a little 42+53.ろしい 42+54.式.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I thought I didn't want to see it anymore.
--------------------------------------------------End--

"O 42+55.ino,
walk a little more quietly..."
--------------------------------------------------End--
