{Yuna} 
...Goodbye.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord {Yuna}, about me...
Don't forget me!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'll be a good boy!
I promise!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Take this with you!
Dad said it's a farewell gift.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm keeping a lookout every day to see if 『{Sin} 』 will come!
(part of line 8)
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone from {Aurochs}...
Has everyone from __P0__ still not returned?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I want to join the Tōbatsutai, but...
They won't let me in.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If we defeat 『{Sin} 』...
Will the monsters disappear too, I wonder?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Have a good trip!
I'll be waiting for souvenirs!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, hey! On the boat...
Where are you going~?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord {Yuna}'s Nagi Shop, still not yet~?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hehe, playing {Yuna}-sama!
I'm going to become a Summoner too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A boat is flying in the sky.
I really saw it!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because I sang well, as a reward...
{Yuna}-sama's Nagi shop is coming, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

They say guys speaking strange words...
...are wandering around. Be careful.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Summoner-sama who came to the island the other day had...
...a Guard about my age.
{NEWPAGE}

Was the Guard's name {Pacce}, I wonder?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Monk-soldiers came looking for {Yuna}-sama.
Everyone kept quiet, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--

With just songs, can we defeat '{Sin}', I wonder...?
...can we defeat '__P0__', I wonder...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

That a day like this would come someday...
...I knew it, though...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Regarding {Yuna}-sama...
I'm entrusting them to you, truly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Here, bring it.
When you're in trouble, you're supposed to leave.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just recently, the Summoner's...
...party arrived.
{NEWPAGE}

But then they suddenly disappeared.
I wonder where they went?
--------------------------------------------------End--

If I recall, Master P0...
...was that their name?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I heard rumors from the sailors.
Is it true that Master P0 is 42+53.ing?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Master P0 would never 42+53. and give up their journey...
...I don't think so...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people of P0 are allies of Master P1.
Whenever 42+54. occurs, come back anytime.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That flying ship is P0's...
...a gift, perhaps...
--------------------------------------------------End--

On the battlefield, with P0 and P1...
...I got separated.
{NEWPAGE}

When will both of them...
...return...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

That operation was definitely not in vain.
I mean, {Sin} hasn't shown itself recently, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm currently 42+55.42+56. in preparation for {Sin}.
It's not like I'm slacking off.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Sin} is still alive, right?
It looks like {Crusader}'s turn might be coming.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Sin} has been quiet lately.
Were you able to repel {Crusader} and 42+57.?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'll tell you some special news.
{NEWPAGE}

{High Summoner Braska}-sama's daughter and...
I heard that {Guado2}'s master will 結42+53..
--------------------------------------------------End--

What? You already knew?
You should have told me earlier.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Perhaps it's because the temple is in chaos...
The number of passengers has decreased too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Just for one 42+58., on that flying ship...
I'd like to try riding it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ahhh! What I wanted to say...
Even though there's so much.
{NEWPAGE}

When I see {Yuna}-chan's 42+59....
I can't say anything at all...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ughhh! The sea is full of monsters!
Please give this to {Yuna}-chan.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I won't cry...
Oh, I won't cry!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Are you really leaving...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

This is a parting gift for your journey.
It's the villagers' feelings.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Everyone for seeing 42+60 off...
I understand why they didn't come.
{NEWPAGE}

If we stay here, saying goodbye...
It's even harder.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To the departing summoner,
May {Yevon2}'s 42+61. be.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To 42+62 the summoner's departure,
Let us 42+64 the 42+63 passed down in the temple.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It will likely be a long journey.
Believe in the teachings and proceed with resolve.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's going to {Blue} 【{Kilika Island} 】{White}.
Will you ride?
