The conflict between {Biran} and {Kimahri}
Began 10 years ago.
{NEWPAGE}

{Ronso}'s clan fights among comrades,
Comparing each other's strength.
{NEWPAGE}

Even if {Kimahri} is defeated by {Biran},
They did not admit defeat even once.
{NEWPAGE}

The {Biran} who had left the place
Broke off {Kimahri}'s horn.
{NEWPAGE}

{Kimahri} could not endure the shame,
Abandoned the mountain and left.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Kimahri} became silent
From the time their horn was broken off.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Biran} and {Yenke} are {Ronso}'s successors.
They do not harbor resentment, even if defeated.
{NEWPAGE}

They will probably sincerely admire {Kimahri}
Who seized victory with their true strength.
--------------------------------------------------End--

For {Kimahri} to defeat {Biran}...
It seems {they} have spent a fruitful ten years.
--------------------------------------------------End--

For a man of {Ronso}, his horn...
...to have his horn broken is the greatest shame.
{NEWPAGE}

{Kimahri}, who lost his horn...
It's a mystery why {he} was able to return.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The current {Kimahri} shows no sign of shame.
Has {he} obtained something more important than a horn?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Can you hear the sound of the wind sweeping through the ranks?
It is praising {Kimahri}'s victory.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The cold wind raging on the sacred mountain...
...is fiercer than {Ronso}'s fangs.
{NEWPAGE}

The weak have their path blocked.
...and buried in the blizzard, they perish.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Prepare your equipment, and steel your resolve.
Aim for the summit of the Spirit Peaks.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do not worry, little guard.
{Ronso} will protect the Summoner's back.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even in old age, all {Ronso} are warriors.
To fulfill the duty of protecting the sacred mountain.

{Ronso} sharpens its fangs day and night.

That {Kimahri} who abandoned the sacred mountain 10 years ago,
That __P0__ would return, having 42+70. gallantly.
{NEWPAGE}

There is nothing left to regret.
It is truly {Yevon2}'s blessing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Now, go.
霊列{Gagazet} is waiting.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That {Kimahri} gained great power
is probably thanks to Summoner {Yuna}.

On behalf of all {Ronso},
I shall 42+71. offer my thanks.

Eventually, the temple's pursuers will come.

There is a legend like this,
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
A little before 『{Sin} 』 appears……
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
{Zanarkand} and {Bevelle}
It was when 42+72. was occurring fiercely.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
The {Bevelle} army that assaulted and climbed {Gagazet},
Heard a song echoing on the snowy mountain.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
To a singing voice that seemed not of this world,
The soldiers were terrified and fled, it is said.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
And then, as if pursuing the 42+73.ing army,
『{Sin} 』 appeared.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Eventually, {Bevelle}'s 42+74.42+75. unit...
Climbed {Gagazet}...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
The destruction of {Zanarkand},
Confirmed with their own eyes.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
The 42+76. city was utterly destroyed,
Every single resident vanished.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Instead, in {Gagazet},
There were countless {fayth}-sama...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
They were singing.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Yes, today, it's called a song of prayer,
And a song that is 42+77. called.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Well, that's about it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
There's more, though?

{Maechen} 
May I continue the story?

{Maechen} 
Regarding the '{Sin}' that suddenly appeared...
The people of {Bevelle} rumored.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
The people of {Zanarkand} becoming {fayth}...
...might have created '{Sin}'.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
The one who performed that spell was...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
The summoner who controlled {Zanarkand}...
...might have been {Yevon2}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Yes, {Yunalesca}-sama's father, isn't that right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
When {Zanarkand} was destroyed...
{Yunalesca}-sama...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
...fled with 42+80.'s {Zaon}-sama, and...
...they were gone.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
After that, the two of them used the Ultimate Summon to...
...defeated '{Sin}'.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
However, the people of {Bevelle}...
...still blamed Summoner {Yevon2}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
So, in an attempt to appease {Yevon2}'s anger...
They spread teachings praising {Yevon2}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
This was the beginning of the {Yevon2} Temple.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Could it be Lord {Yunalesca}...
...was aiming for that, perhaps.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Instead of me defeating '{Sin}',
...so that Father {Yevon2}'s name would remain.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Of course, there was no 42+82.42+83. at all.
Everything is in the darkness of 42+84.42+85.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
That {Yevon2} was {Bevelle}'s enemy,
...could never be publicly announced.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Therefore, the temple... this 42+84.42+85.
...keeps completely secret.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Well, that's about it.

{Maechen} 
May I speak further?

{Maechen} 
Well then, about the Song of Prayer...
Let's speak of it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
That was originally against {Bevelle}...
...the song of {Zanarkand} who rebelled.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
At that 42+86., the {Yevon2} Temple...
...prohibited singing.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Then, those who did not obey the temple...
I came to enjoy singing.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
For example, {Al Bhed}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Songs of prayer represent the 42+87.42+88. to the temple.
It became a song.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
The temple that 42+89. its hands changed its policy.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
They lifted the ban on songs.
Twisting its 42+90.rai...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Songs that soothe the souls of the dead.
That's what they made it out to be.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
And so, that song
was incorporated into the temple's teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Thanks to that, songs of prayer now
have spread throughout {Spira}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
In other words, the {Zanarkand} that vanished from the world
only survived within the songs.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
Oh, this has turned into quite
a long talk.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Maechen} 
I was happy to be able to speak, so I just...

No, no, I'm grateful for being allowed to talk

Therefore, {Ronso} abandons the 42+95.
Faces sorrow.

All the people of {Ronso} are warriors.
At least those who remained will protect the sacred mountain.

It would be too early to abandon the teachings.

I will not lose to monsters.

Tempered by snow and ice.
I will grow as big as the mountain.
