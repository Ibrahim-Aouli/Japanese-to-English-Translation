So that 'Shin' doesn't come again.
We must pray very well.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The one who will win this year isn't Gowers,
Nor O'Aka!
{NEWPAGE}

Our Kilika Beasts will...
They're sure to win!
--------------------------------------------------End--

'{Sin}' seems to have gone far away.
Our prayers were worth it!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Did you know? If you see a flying ship,
They say to sing a prayer song.
{NEWPAGE}

They say you can defeat '{Sin}' if you sing, but...
Whether I should believe it...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, it's a vague rumor, but...
Let's try believing it, just once.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I tried singing the prayer song as the rumor said, but...
What kind of spell was that?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I climb those stone steps every day.
Thanks to that, I don't feel my age.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I was a Blitz player when I was young, you know.
I used to compete with players from other teams.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Your brother's 42+53. I recognize it.
Surely you came for the prayer for victory 42+54., didn't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The number of people coming to the temple has significantly decreased.
Indeed, it's truly regrettable.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We 42+55. have decided to leave Kilika.
We will search for a place 'Sin' doesn't come.
{NEWPAGE}

If such a place exists.
I don't know, though...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Gowaaz bunch looks strong, but...
They give a good impression, don't they?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't want to live in Kilika anymore.
There are just too many sad memories.
{NEWPAGE}

I came for my final visit before leaving the island.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A little earlier than you all.
The Summoner-sama and the Guard entered the trial.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When we were training in the forest at the foot of the mountain...
We were confident of the mission success 42+56.
{NEWPAGE}

But now, our own...
...foolishness, we realized...
{NEWPAGE}

To the teachings that have continued for 1000 years.
It was a mistake to defy.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{P0}'s {P1} is soon.
It is planned for them to disband and be reformed as warrior monks.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I decided not to become a warrior monk.
They prioritize the temple over the people.
{NEWPAGE}

Abandoning {P0}'s defense...
...and fleeing was a good example.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The forces of the warrior monk corps are in the Holy {P0} Temple.
They are said to be holed up.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The punitive force, without relying on the Summoner's power,
seems to intend to fight 'Sin'.
{NEWPAGE}

Reckless, or rather, sacrilegious...
I don't care what happens.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When a Blitz player comes to this temple,
I really feel the tournament is approaching.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I quit {P0} and...
I became a warrior monk to protect the temple!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monk I serve, Lord {P0}...
Protected Lord {P0}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

No, I am not a warrior monk!
I have returned to {Crusader} as a woman!
{NEWPAGE}

Since there isn't enough {Crusader} equipment,
I am wearing warrior monk equipment!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I don't mind being {Crusader} or a warrior monk!
I want to do work that protects something!
--------------------------------------------------End--

If I stay here,
I heard I could meet celebrities here, but...
{NEWPAGE}

Where on earth could they be?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Could it be... could it be...
I wonder if those people from earlier were the celebrities?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The sight of '{Sin}' that ravaged the town,
I still see in my dreams and suffer from nightmares.
{NEWPAGE}

Even though I am a monk official, I cannot suppress my personal desires.
I feel pathetic.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Precisely now that the temple is being desecrated, I must brace myself,
I must live by the path of the teachings!
{NEWPAGE}

...I think so, but no matter what, in my heart...
Doubt arises.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My training is still insufficient.
It can't be helped if I'm called unfit as a monk official.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That flying ship is the temple's machine... right?
Yes, I'll choose to believe that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
You all also, to Lord/Lady {Ohalland}...
A certain victory 祈42+54.?
--------------------------------------------------End--

A 祈42+54.?
--------------------------------------------------End--

We, the {Luca Goers}, are ever-victorious!
We don't need things like 祈42+54.!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Then why are you here?
--------------------------------------------------End--

So that stronger teams appear.
We prayed for that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Your team's 目42+75. this time also...
Is it that "do your best" approach?
--------------------------------------------------End--

With such a petty mindset...
First-round elimination is certain this year too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
This time, we're aiming for consecutive victories!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh~ aim, aim.
Anyone can aim.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
See you in the finals!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
We'll definitely win against them.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Is it a team you know?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Looking down on people, making fools of them...
That attitude is like my dad.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
{Jecht}-san was kind, and
Was a fun person.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
That's someone else.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's been 10 years since he disappeared...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yet, when I think about my dad,
My feelings stirred.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The feelings I should have been suppressing,
My feelings for {Zanarkand}
--------------------------------------------------End--

Swelled... and burst.
My {42+53.} got intensely hot.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Are you okay?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
I might not be... alright.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
What do you want to do?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
...Maybe I want to scream.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
WAAAHHHHHH!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto.
To think you can do both Blitz and battle!
You're really so versatile!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto.
I prayed for victory for {42+77.} years, but
I ended up losing in the first round.
{NEWPAGE}
Datto.
My prayers must not have been enough.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto.
If I were to confront Gowarz...
My legs ended up trembling.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Reti!
So this is the land connected to Lord {P0}...
Somehow, it makes me feel solemn.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Reti!
It's burning everywhere, isn't it?
{NEWPAGE}
Reti!
Since the time of Lord {P0}...
They say it's a fire that has never gone out.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Reti!
That guy from Gowarz, he's called Bixun.
It's an unpleasant thought, but Blitz's skill is truly first-class.
--------------------------------------------------End--
