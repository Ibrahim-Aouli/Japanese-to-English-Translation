{Wakka} 
Heh heh heh...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
These stone steps, you see...
They are historically proper stone steps.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
During the current era, Lord {Ohalland}...
...trained here!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Aurochs} Everyone:
Heh heh heh...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
It's a match, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Do you think you can win against me?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
{Yuna}, please.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Ready!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Huh!?
Unfair!?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Always a child, aren't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto.
This is bad~!!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Hurry! Help!
It's 『{sinspawn}』!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
This is tough~
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Hahaha... I was fortunate.
I ended up underestimating you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Guarding is tough, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
You, even with battles,
...seem to have talent, don't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Stop it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Hey, what is '{sinspawn} '?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Peeled off from '{Sin} 's body,
A demon that was left behind.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
If you leave it alone, '{Sin} ' will return.
We'd better defeat it quickly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That it might have battle capabilities...
...when {Wakka} told me...
--------------------------------------------------End--

At that time, about becoming {Yuna} 's guard...
I feel like I started to think about it in the back of my mind.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Oh, right... that.
Are there demons in {Zanarkand}?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Not many.
If one appears sometimes, it's a major [42+53] incident.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Things about {Zanarkand}...
...even though you don't believe them.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
...I was thinking, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Humans who are harmed by '{Sin} '...
...instead of dying...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
...by '{Sin} 's magic, 1000 years ago or something...
...I wonder if they're transported to a world later or something.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
And then one day, suddenly 42+54. popped up.
Returning and such...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
As always, I'm impressed.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Ways to deceive yourself, one after another.
I said I was impressed because you devise them.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
『{Sin} 』 did not transport {Chappu}
anywhere.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Crushing 42+55.
and abandoned it on {Djose}'s coast.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Your 42+56. is...
...will never 42+57. return.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
And also, I'll tell you this.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
No matter how much you wish for it,
no one can replace {Chappu}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
A replacement for {Jecht}-sama, too,
is nowhere to be found...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Of course, even a replacement for {Braska}-sama
is nowhere to be found.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
That kind of thinking... will only make you sad.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Even I, a replacement for 42+56. like that...
I can't do it...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Well, a lot happened.
Don't worry about it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Wakka} and {Lulu} and
Between this {Chappu}...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Yes, something I didn't know.
That there were 複42+58.な42+53. feelings...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I understood at least that much.
But I was not good with such topics.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You there!
Suspicious one!
