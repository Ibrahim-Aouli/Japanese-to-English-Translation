{Wakka} 
Hey, hey, hey!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
{Dona} and the Lined Meat Man
Forcibly, you know...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Regardless of Riten,
It is {Yuna} who will face the ordeal.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
An ordeal...? What kind?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Entering and exiting the temple could also be forbidden.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
From this point on, it is only for Summoners.
A sacred place.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Even the guards can't enter?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Yes.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Be quiet.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
What's inside here?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Lord {fayth} is present.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Oh, that's it!
You said that earlier, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
In order to defeat 『{Sin} 』
They are people who willingly sacrificed their lives.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
By {Yevon2}'s technique, while still living,
Their souls were extracted from their bodies...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Huh?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Sealed in the {fayth} statue.
42+53.Live for ages...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
The soul of Master {fayth}, by the summoner's
prayer, appears.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
That is... a Summoned Beast.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Inside this room?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Yu {Yuna} is inside...
What is she doing?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
She's desperately praying, '
Lend me the power to defeat `__P0__`.'
--------------------------------------------------End--


At that time, to everyone...
...there was something I had kept silent about.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The song that was being heard there...
...was a song I had known since childhood.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Zanarkand} and {Spira} were somewhere...
...connected 42+55.42+56.... I thought so.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder if it was because I noticed that.
The feeling of wanting to return suddenly grew strong.
--------------------------------------------------End--

42+57.it felt like [42+57.] got stuck...
...I became unable to say anything at all.
--------------------------------------------------End--
