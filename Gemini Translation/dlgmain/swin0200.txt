{Tidus} 
What are you talking about?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Bixson
What an overly familiar fellow.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Graab
Oh, this guy... it's that...
You met him at {Kilika}, didn't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Bixson
Huh?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Graab
See? The guy from {Besaid Aurochs}.
He was spouting about defeating the shop.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Bixson
Ah...
That naive guy?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
What a terrible thing to say.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Bixson
Well, it can't be helped.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Bixson
Naturally, {Aurochs} should get stronger.
But there's no way, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
If I join, it'll get stronger!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Yes, it will get stronger!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
He's from {Zanarkand}'s team...
He was the ace, after all!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Bixson
Hah! Well, that's quite something.
He came from quite a place.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Graab
To think there are even teams in the ruins...
I didn't know that, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Not ruins, but a proper...
There's a large capital city!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Oh, umm, I... because of {Sin}'s venom...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
It truly exists.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Bixson
Speaking of the Summoner...
I don't understand.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
What's wrong?
Weren't they getting a little worked up?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Those people are rude, and...
Besides...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Your {Zanarkand} is...
I'm sure it's somewhere.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Why?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
After asking {Jecht}...
I've longed for it all this time.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Someday I want to go...
...I was thinking.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I hope you can return, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Yes.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wanted to say something like, "Want to come to my place?"
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I think about the reason I can't say that...
I became sad.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Say something.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
You'd think it's pointless, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
It's fine, I'm telling you.
There's someone he knows in {Luca}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
What if there isn't?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Then, to some team...
...join or something...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Anyway, rather than staying in {Besaid}...
It's many times better, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
In short...
So, the rest is up to me?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
What am I supposed to do?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
{Yuna} wants him to be a guard.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Ah... that's it!
This has become troublesome, hasn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Who made Original 42+56.?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Are you saying it was me?!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
It was me, wasn't it...?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Hey, why is {Yuna}
so eager to make him a guard?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Because he's Lord {Jecht}'s son.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Ah, I see.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
But is that true?
Is he truly Lord {Jecht}'s son?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Regardless of the truth,
{Yuna} believes it to be so.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
I see.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
"I see, I see."
Are you thinking properly?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
I am thinking, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
In the end, it's his decision.
It's his and {Yuna}'s decision, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
You're saying something sensible.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Hmph!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
What would be...
...the best, I wonder...?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Why don't you suggest it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
What?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Becoming {Yuna}'s guard.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Why me?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
{Yuna} can't say it, can she?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Why?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
She dislikes Father42+57. and his shadow...
...and doesn't want it cast upon her.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
To someone who says such things...
Do you think you can say it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Because you are Lord {Jecht}'s son.
That I want you to be my guard.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Aren't you worrying too much?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
I understand.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
After the tournament ends and things settle down.
I'll try talking to him.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
You mustn't force him.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
I know.
He's the one who decides.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Does he hate his father {42+57.}?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
It seems so.
I heard it from {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Hates his dad, huh...
That's quite a luxury, isn't it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
As for me, about my parents {42+57.}...
I don't even remember them...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
There's no liking or hating either...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
I was... {542+58.}, so...
I remember a little.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Damn it!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
"{Sin}" everything and anything...
They're taking it...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
I'm thinking a bit, so...
It's Megumi.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
It's about time to 42+59.toke.
It's the match right after we get to {Luca}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
I hope I find someone I know.
During the match, stand 42+60.te out with all your might!

What kind of technique is that?

There's no name for it.
Anyone can do it if they practice.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Could you do that one more time?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
You're no ordinary person, after all.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
That was the {Jecht} Shot just now, wasn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
You tried to do the {Jecht} Shot, didn't you?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Why do you know?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
When I was a child, {Jecht}-san...
...showed it to me.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
The official name is...
"‘{Jecht}-sama Shot Number 3’"... right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
That's a silly name, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
And besides, there aren't actually Numbers 1 or 2.
There aren't any, you know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
If you say "Number 3", both Number 1 and Number 2...
...customers expect there to be.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
He said those customers would come to the stadium, thinking they might finally see it tonight...
42+65.42+66. ...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
And then it really turned out that way...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
I got really angry.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Is Dad alive?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I don't know.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
But you know, {Jecht}...
because he was my father's guard...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Is he famous here too?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Yes.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
So if he died...
I think that news would have reached us.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Hmm.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Hey, if you could meet him... what would you do?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
It's the guy you thought was dead 10 years ago, you know?
At this late stage...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Hmm...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
I'd punch him first.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Because of that guy, I also...
And 42+67. also struggled...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Because that guy is famous...
I'm always...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
{Yuna}, you'd understand, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
{Yuna}'s father is famous too, right?
Everyone in this world knows him, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Don't you dislike it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Sometimes, my father's name...
I do feel it's a burden sometimes...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Well, {Yuna}'s dad and
my dad are different.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Poor {Jecht}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
W-What about me?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
You're even more pitiful, aren't you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Do that again!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
What are you two doing?!
It's about time to 42+59.re~!
--------------------------------------------------End--

That Dad would come to {Luca}...
I couldn't imagine.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That guy, watching other people's 42+69....
...he hated it, you see.
--------------------------------------------------End--

But something would definitely happen.
I had such a 42+70.42+71.gi feeling that I couldn't sleep.
--------------------------------------------------End--

"I'll perform at the tournament, ssu!" -- what I was saying was...
...it was feigned cheerfulness to distract from my anxiety, you see.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This year's {Aurochs}...
...might be able to make it?
{NEWPAGE}

A player who came from {Zanarkand}...
...is in, I heard.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm astonished.
You believe a rumor like that?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Of course I don't believe it.
I mean it'll be a good show.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
What do you mean, "special"?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
More than that, he's admired by all of Spira...
I wonder if I'm proud of Father.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto.
It seems you still have some venom.
Don't push yourself. Get it done early.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto.
I wanted to do my last practice at {Kilika}, but...
With the town in that state, it's impossible, isn't it...?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto.
When {Yuna} is watching me...
For some reason, I get nervous.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Datto.
Ow, ow, ow... my back...
--------------------------------------------------End--
Reti!
It seems {Wakka} is busy.
Wouldn't it be better not to disturb them?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Reti!
In the tournament pairings, with Gowers...
Let's pray we don't get matched!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Reti!
Is Datt okay?
Just don't get hurt...
--------------------------------------------------End--
Reti!
Making a shot like that, that's incredible.
Is that what an ace is like, as expected?

Gowaz didn't see us, right?
Let's keep it hidden until the main event!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The {Aurochs} crowd
They're pushing themselves too hard before the main event.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's their choice to practice in the sea, but
The ship won't wait for them anymore.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They really are an unreasonable bunch.
Do you want to 遠42+76 to {Luca}?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wish they'd consider our position too.
{NEWPAGE}

If the ship gets 42+77.ed, the crew's
You'll be held responsible.
--------------------------------------------------End--

By {Luca}'s Gowers fans.
We'll be 42+78.thrashed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

All the residents of {Luca} are Gowers fans.
For you, it's like enemy territory.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I liked {Aurochs}'s level of foolishness.
Do your best in the tournament.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're a player from {Zanarkand}, aren't you?
Stir things up as much as you can.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You've been scurrying around for a while.
They're recording Lord {Yuna} on a Sphere.
--------------------------------------------------End--

More 42+59....? You say it's a 42+59.shortage?
You'll drown during the match.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Since there's a Summoner-sama here too.
Don't get in the way of the ship's 42+79.navigation.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The current 42+80.sea has many troublesome guests.
There's also the excommunicated {Crusader}...
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Zanarkand}, huh...
{NEWPAGE}

If you're going to 42+81.boast...
Make it a more decent tall tale.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You can say you came from {Zanarkand} so easily.
