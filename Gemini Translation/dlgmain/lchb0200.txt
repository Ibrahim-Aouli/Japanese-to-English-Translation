M-Are you alright now?!
My legs froze up...

The ferry docked at the port...
{Blue} It's the [{Kilika Port}] bound for {White}.

If you go straight, it's {Blue} [Port 3] {White}.
The opposite is {Blue} [Port 1] {White}.

If you travel across the seas of {Spira}...
You stop being surprised by most things.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Fortunate customer.
The ferry will be 応42+53. for a while.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Blue} It's the [{Luca}={Kilika}] ferry for the {White} 運42+53. period.
Do you wish to board, customer?

When preparations are complete, let me know.
Then, we'll depart for {Kilika}.

Hey, hey! Let me through, let me through!
You're in the way of my work!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Alright, move aside, move aside!
Because we're departing soon.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What about {Al Bhed}'s machines?!
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you're surprised by that much...
You won't be able to survive in {Spira}'s sea!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Alright, out of the way, out of the way!
We're in the middle of checking cargo sorting.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Preparation is a mundane task, but for {Crusader}'s revival's...
As the first step, I will do my best.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Suspicious individuals on the ferry...
We are preparing to prevent them from boarding.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Now that the monk army is gone...
Only {Crusader} can protect {Luca}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Monk soldiers are not responsible for internal affairs.
Don't talk to me about trivial matters.
--------------------------------------------------End--

No problems!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I want to become a sailor and
travel all over {Spira}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ship... ship...
A big ship...
--------------------------------------------------End--

My sister, the other day, tried to sneak onto the ferry
and got caught.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Big sister, you get too carried away.
She really likes ships...
--------------------------------------------------End--

42+62.42+63. wants to ride a ship, you see...
Even if I tell them the sea is dangerous, they won't listen.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I hear 42+62. wants to become a sailor in the future.
I intended for 42+64. to be graceful, but...
