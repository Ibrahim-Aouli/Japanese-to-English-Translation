{Wakka} 
What's wrong?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
{Yuna}, you see...
They said you should come along too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Hey...
Is it okay if I don't act as a guard?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
What's that?
Stop joking, {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
This one can handle blitz, but...
They're a novice when it comes to fighting monsters.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Is it okay even if I'm not a guard?
As long as you're by my side...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
What's that? What do you mean?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
That's... um...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Everyone's going to the temple anyway, so...
We can talk about it later, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Sorry, that was sudden.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Even if you say "sorry"...
What is it? I don't understand.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
...I'm sorry.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
See? I told you.
It's impossible to defeat them, I'm telling you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
Finishing the battle and going back to sleep, that is...
That is why it is suitable for the forest.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
Don't do that.
No matter what 42+53. you do, you can't win.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Amazing!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
You're capable... all of you.
As expected of a Summoner and a Guard.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Go 42+54. ahead!
We cannot afford to lose, can we?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
Of course, we won't lose.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Come forth~42+55. people~{Crusader}~42+56.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Defeat 'Sin'~
Even that cute person will turn around~42+56.
--------------------------------------------------End--

42+57. Training! 42+57. Training!
--------------------------------------------------End--

*Pant*... *pant*...
42+57. Training! 42+57. Training!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
Ochu's strength is
on a completely different level from other monsters.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
Even if a bunch of {Crusader} team up,
it's doubtful if it can be defeated.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
If you get hit by Ochu's poison,
you'll be {Farplane} in an instant.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
That monster is the Lord Ochu of this forest.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
It's an unmanageable one, 42+58.42+59. even for {Crusader}.
Avoid a futile 42+60. fight here.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Luzzu} 
Please let {Wakka} have a good time.
I'm counting on you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
42+61.42+62.Caution! 42+61.42+62.Caution!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
All stop!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
Don't even think about testing your strength.
Don't think of it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Gatta} 
When the tournament ends, you should join {Crusader}.
Join us! 42+63.42+64. I'll make it happen.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I saw it! You managed to defeat the Ochu!
I'd like to scout you for {Crusader}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

In celebration of your victory, let me present this 42+65. to you.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Be careful of the Lord Ochu of the forest.
It's a powerful monster. We {Crusader} are also 42+61.42+62. on alert.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Are you visiting {Blue} 【{Kilika Temple} 】{White}?
To the temple, go through that animal path.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Poisonous monsters also appear in the forest.
Carelessness is forbidden!
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Crusader} is training for the upcoming major operation.
If you witness '{sinspawn}', please report it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Are you alright? Don't waste your life!
Sometimes a detour is necessary.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Monsters are everywhere.
Please don't forget your vigilance.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The subjugation of stray monsters...
...is one of {Crusader}'s important missions.
{NEWPAGE}

At least let the souls of the dead rest peacefully.
I want to pray for {Farplane}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To all the guards, thank you for your hard work!
{NEWPAGE}

In areas attacked by '{Sin}',
the number of monsters seems to increase.
{NEWPAGE}

Please be careful on your way.
