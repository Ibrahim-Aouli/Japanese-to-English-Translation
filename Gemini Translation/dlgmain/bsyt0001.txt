……It's really...
--------------------------------------------------End--

It truly was a world I didn't know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lord {Braska} became the Grand Summoner.
It has been 10 years since then.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Finally, to this temple as well...
...sacred images were enshrined.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Grand Summoner... what's that?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Um, I was exposed to {Sin}'s poisonous aura...
...I ended up getting affected by it!
--------------------------------------------------End--

I kept saying the same thing many times...
...and found myself a little strange... and lonely.
--------------------------------------------------End--

A Summoner is... through mystical arts...
...one who protects our {Yevon2} people.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What chosen Summoners wield are...
...sacred beasts without flesh or blood: Summoned Beasts.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Summoned Beasts who appear in response to prayers...
...are great gifts from {Yevon2}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

In short,
--------------------------------------------------End--

...to those somehow amazing people,
I thought it meant to give thanks.
--------------------------------------------------End--

One who is not a Guard...
Do not approach the Hall of Trials.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you pray devoutly,
Even the poison will likely be cured.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The sacred statues of the Great Summoners are, from the right,
Lord {Braska}, Lord Yonkun...
{NEWPAGE}

Lord Oharando and Lord Gandofu.
Well? Did you recall?
--------------------------------------------------End--

By Lord {High Summoner Gandof}'s power.
Please protect my family...
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I was a child 42+53., the village...
...was attacked by 『{Sin} 』42+54..
{NEWPAGE}

The village 42+55. became a desolate wasteland. On that day...
I still dream of it, even now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To disturb people's prayers...
...that goes against the teachings.
--------------------------------------------------End--

May Jusho-sama return 42+56.safely...
(No translation for this line, combined with #17)
--------------------------------------------------End--

Watched over by Lord {Braska}.
Jusho-sama is probably 42+57. eager too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I like Ohaland-sama the 42+58. most.
They really 42+59. resemble my deceased grandpa.
--------------------------------------------------End--
