I felt like I sensed my father...
--------------------------------------------------End--

No way...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Is this the poisonous aura of 『{Sin} 』?
...I was just saying.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Haha...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wonder how many people died.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Every time someone dies, 『{Yuna} 』 forms a line.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That sad procession...
Yuna, how many more times?
--------------------------------------------------End--

As long as 『{Sin} 』 is here.
Will 『{Yuna} 』 continue to form a line...?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I think I was thinking such things...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
I couldn't return home.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Huh?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
Many stories ended.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
But...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
It seems your story continues.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Ah...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I... couldn't return home.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
That's a quick retreat.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
Satisfied?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kinoc} 
What does that mean?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
Soldiers who defied the teachings died, and...
Only obedient monk soldiers remained.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kinoc} 
Hmm...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Kinoc} 
It cannot be the same as before.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymour} 
Your expression isn't good.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymour} 
However, even at this {P0} degree, it is precisely at a time like this when...
You must act resolutely.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymour} 
If you were an ordinary person, sometimes...
...it would be alright to immerse yourself in sadness.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymour} 
But you are a Summoner.
You are the people's hope itself.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymour} 
Weakness will not be permitted until you defeat "{P0}".
You must keep this well in mind.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Yes... I will apply myself.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymour} 
Are you worried?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymour} 
In that case, I will become {42+53.え}.
Like {{Zaon}} who {42+53.えた} {{Yunalesca}}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Seymour} 
The rest, when we meet again someday.
Well then.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
『{Sin} 』 is {Jecht}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
The truth is... I thought it might be the case.
I just thought that a moment ago.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Just so you know.
It's not like I believed it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
"{Sin}" is {Jecht}.
42+54. came to meet you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
To meet me.
Are you saying they killed many people?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
That is "{Sin}".
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
Their true form... to you...
...they must have come to show.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
Do you know why?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Not at all.
How should I know?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
It's to be killed by you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
As long as they remain "{Sin}".
{Jecht} will 42+55.i continue to kill.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
That... from you...
...they want stopped.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Don't mess around.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
How could you possibly... such a thing?
...know?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
Heh...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
It's the 42+56. middle of the conversation, isn't it!
Don't run away!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
You too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
You got close to 『{Sin} 』 again, didn't you?
The poison... are you alright?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
{Yuna} was worried.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
{Yuna} worrying about others...
...even though this isn't the time for it...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
We shouldn't go against the teachings, should we...?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
We'll depart after a short rest.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Hehehe...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
It's tough, isn't it...?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Let's pull ourselves together... and do our best.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
Are you alright?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
Then...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Shelinda} 
Yes, thank you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
With Operation Special 42+57.42+58.
We made quite a profit, but...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
...if things turn out like this,
...it leaves a bad taste...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
After all, the Summoner...
...we have no choice but to rely on them to do their best, do we?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{O'aka} 
Huh? You want to make a deal?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ugh... water...
Give me water...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Mother...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The soldiers who were fighting on the front lines
Not even half survived.
{NEWPAGE}

My subordinates were also wiped out.
{Crusader} is... beyond recovery.
--------------------------------------------------End--

We who broke the teachings,
...were we foolish?
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm... lucky.
Because I'm still alive.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Compared to the dead 42+54.s,
Such a wound is nothing... *gufuh*
--------------------------------------------------End--

This wasn't supposed to happen.
...wasn't meant to be.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Damn it!
How many died?
--------------------------------------------------End--

If things like this are lying around,
...it's like a road closure.
{NEWPAGE}

Because 42+60.42+61. is impassable, we're transporting 42+60. by human power.
{NEWPAGE}

The people from {Al Bhed}, the things they used...
I wish they would clean up properly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Such junk, right in the middle of the highway...
Left lying around, it's such a bother……
--------------------------------------------------End--

For the soldiers who lost their lives in a 42+62.less operation,
we are offering prayers.
{NEWPAGE}

Their foolishness for breaking the teachings,
they must be lamenting in {Farplane}……
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because of {Al Bhed}'s machines, many 42+63. people
died in battle. It is a tragic thing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The warrior monks who were 42+64.ing the highway
have disappeared.
{NEWPAGE}

{St. Bevelle} Shrine...
They say they're going to 42+65. it.
{NEWPAGE}

Well, {Bevelle} is important, but...
What about the safety of travelers?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Not just {Bevelle},
I wish they would consider the common people a little.
