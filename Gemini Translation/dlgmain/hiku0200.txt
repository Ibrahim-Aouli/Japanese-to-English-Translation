{Dona} 
You can tell by looking.
Are you in line?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
If you have no business here.
Will you leave me alone?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
...Alright.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
Wait.
I have a question for you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
If I said I was quitting my journey...
...what would you think?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{CHOICE:30} Go ahead and quit.
{CHOICE:31} Do as you please.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
That's unusual.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
Most people, about giving up the journey...
...are harsh on Summoners.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Is that so?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
They'll say you ran away from your duty...
...and point fingers.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
It's fine, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Let them talk.
Do as you like.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
Don't speak so arrogantly.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
But that might be good too...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
With {Barthello}, just the two of us.
I wonder if we should run far away.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
That's harsh.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
When I first met you,
you were harsher.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
That's true.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
To be told "Do as you please,"
Stopping the journey would be annoying.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
If you meet {Yuna},
please tell them.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
I will continue to be {Yuna}'s
rival.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
So you too, do your utmost,
"do your best..."
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
Make sure to tell them.
Understood?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
Thank you for listening.
I feel refreshed somehow.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
Let's leave this place, and the Summon Beast...
Can't respond.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Dona} 
I'll leave it to you.
Show me something good.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Isaaru} 
42+53. and others, handle another section!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Despite all the hardship to build {Home}...
Everything turned to ashes.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You {Guado}, come anytime!
I'll be your opponent!
--------------------------------------------------End--

To the warriors in {Luca}...
Must convey this.
--------------------------------------------------End--

My comrades died protecting {summoner}.
I'll be everyone's shield too!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The reaction of 『{Sin}』 is...
It seems it cannot be detected.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you're ready...
I'll find 『{Sin}』 for you anytime!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Centered around 『{Sin}』,
Gravity seems to be disturbed!
--------------------------------------------------End--

『{Sin}』 seems to still be alive.
How will we deliver the finishing blow?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Are we going in head-on?
It's a reckless plan, but exhilarating.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This time for sure, we'll defeat {{Sin}}
Let's put an end to it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's no time for wailing.
We just need to build a new {{Home}}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Alright!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The knack for moving this ship...
...I've finally grasped it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When you fight {{Sin}}
I'll sing here too!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Leave the ship to me.
You, hurry to the deck!
--------------------------------------------------End--

In preparation for the final battle,
I need to adjust the ship.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The ship is in top condition!
Now, go knock down {{Sin}}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if you jump into {{Sin}}
...there seems to be no effect on the ship.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The ship shook a lot just now, didn't it?
I bumped my head.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Not scared, not scared.
Not scared, not scared...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, when can we return to {Home}?
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's better just to be alive even if {Home} is gone.
If I don't think that way, I can't go on...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Because {summoner} is protecting the passage.
Isn't this room safe?
--------------------------------------------------End--

To prepare for the battle, the children
descended from {airship}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It was good to be able to return to Fuji from {Bevelle}.
Before, we were severely attacked.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'll sing here too.
Do your best!
--------------------------------------------------End--

End the battle quickly.
I want to see my younger brother.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Don't dally!
『{Sin}』 is right in front of you!
--------------------------------------------------End--

When {Calm} comes, next time
we must rebuild {Home}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This child doesn't quite understand that {Home} is gone.
よく わかって いないのよ
--------------------------------------------------End--

Being chased around by {fiend}.
Everyone is utterly terrified.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The children's terrified faces...
Seeing them is the hardest thing of all...
--------------------------------------------------End--

{summoner} and {guardian}...
They seem quite troubled.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even I can use a weapon!
I'll show them {Al Bhed}'s resolve!
--------------------------------------------------End--

These are {Rin}-san's belongings.
Don't touch them without permission.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Since there are plenty of items,
please feel free to buy.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do you need anything?
Why don't you consult {Rin}-san?
--------------------------------------------------End--

We have to repair the damaged ship.
I wonder if we have any parts in stock.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It will surely be a tough battle.
Check your equipment again!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Use up all the items here.
Please do it with that intention.
--------------------------------------------------End--
