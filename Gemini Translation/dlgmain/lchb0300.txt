Why is something like that in this port...?

At the Shop Port, our staff will always

This year's tournament, Kyobi is quite the challenge.
I hope nothing happens.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, hey! On the Monk Soldier Army's warship,
you can't just board without permission!
--------------------------------------------------End--

If only...,
a machine like that would be nothing.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I am truly sorry, but
ordinary people cannot board this ship.
--------------------------------------------------End--

You're lucky to be in charge of Kyobi.
And when I'm off duty, I can watch Blitz.

Against machines that defy the teachings,
we cannot lose!

Grand Master Maika's ship.
On guard!

By {Maester Kinoc}'s command.
We are defending {Luca}!
--------------------------------------------------End--

No help needed!
Warrior monks will guard Grand Master's ship!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please don't associate us with the punitive force.
We are warrior monks who uphold Ebon's teachings.

Precisely because the battle with 『{Sin} 』 continues...
...we must play our best game and inspire the people.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Bixson
Whether you are a rebel or not...
...it doesn't matter during the match.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Bixson
For the sake of the {Luca} people, we Gowers...
...must continue to be always victorious.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Bixson
Underestimating {Aurochs} was our biggest failure.
Now, we will crush them with all our strength. Prepare yourself.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Bixson
We {Luca Goers} always stand at the top.
If you're frustrated, then crawl your way back up.

Graab
About Nagi coming? I haven't thought about it.
All I'm thinking about is the next match.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Graab
No matter what happens to the temple, we...
Just play Blitz, that's all.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Graab
If you have time to take a walk,
why don't you improve your Blitz skills?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Graab
Something like {42+66.42+67.} happens.
Your {42+68.} victory is precisely that.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Graab
You avoided a first-round defeat for 24 consecutive years.
Just be satisfied with that.

Ambus
When the flying ship flew off, both the players and the spectators
we all sang together.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Ambus
I heard a rumor that you're rebels.
There were some utterly pointless stories like that too, weren't there?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Ambus
We appreciate you protecting {{Luca}}, but
it's full of monk soldiers everywhere, so it's hard to relax, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Ambus
Ah, I let my guard down and lost.
Even {{Aurochs}} is quite capable, huh.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Ambus
42+68. We won, but thanks to the monster 42+69. activity...
42+70. The victory party is canceled. How unlucky, huh?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Doram
A flying ship is {Al Bhed}'s machine, right?
I wonder if we can really defeat '{Sin}'.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Doram
It seems you've been wandering around everywhere, but...
Are you practicing properly?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Doram
You became a guard, right?
Can you be a player and also hold another job?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Doram
It's not that we lost to {Aurochs}, but to {Wakka}'s...
I'll just say we lost to __P1__'s 42+71. nature.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Doram
The final match was fun.
You showed a cute 42+72. gesture. Not bad.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Bargerda
I hear the next Grand Master hasn't been decided yet.
No matter who it is, it doesn't concern the players.

Bargerda
What are these temples thinking lately?
I completely don't understand.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Bargerda
They're skipping their duties to watch the matches.
There are many monk soldiers. How appalling.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Bargerda
Of all opponents, to someone like {Aurochs}...
To lose... 42+73.42+74. No, that's not it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Bargerda
Well, did you realize the difference in our abilities?
If I feel like it, I'll 42+75. for you again.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Raudia.
I don't know who is on that flying ship, but...
I just hope they manage well.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Raudia.
The Ronzo and Al Bhed teams were hurt.
It seems they intend to cheer up their comrades with Blitz.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Raudia.
I hear that {Crusader} suffered a crushing defeat.
Humph. That's the 42+67. result.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Raudia.
I'll entrust the trophy to you until the next tournament.
Do your utmost to store it away carefully in a 42+76. place.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Raudia.
To think a mere {Aurochs} would be a runner-up 42+68.
The tournament's level has really dropped.
