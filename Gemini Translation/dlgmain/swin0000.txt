The sun feels nice~
--------------------------------------------------End--

Lounging around and slacking off,
It's the best luxury, isn't it~
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I get a lap pillow like this,
I really feel alive~
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even if I work diligently, if {P0} comes,
It's all over.
{NEWPAGE}

Then working is foolish, isn't it?
You'll just waste your life.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sunbathing and lounging around,
It's the best luxury, isn't it~
--------------------------------------------------End--

If {P0} were gone, I'd reform and
Maybe I'd try to work diligently~
{NEWPAGE}

Well, something like {P0} disappearing...
There's no way that would happen, though~
--------------------------------------------------End--

Those people on the flying ship, they're working hard, aren't they~
Shall I even slack off for their share~?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Then I told them:
"That's a cat," I said.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Do you understand~? You understand, right~?
--------------------------------------------------End--

The one who listens to my story is...
There's only you...
--------------------------------------------------End--

The shop folk these days are just too much.
When I'm in town, it's stifling, I can't bear it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Rather than associating with the townspeople...
It's better to be with cute Saru.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The flying ship is {Al Bhed}'s machine, isn't it?
I can't bring myself to support it.
{NEWPAGE}

Even the rumor that Summoner {Yuna} is a rebel...
Apparently, that's a rumor {Al Bhed} spread.
--------------------------------------------------End--

To support someone like {Al Bhed2}...
That's what a Yafurii does.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Riki and Uino too... ugh.
The rest is... *gulp*... later. u.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hoo-haa hoo-haa... Great Summoner
...not as much as Master/Lord... but... Next time!
--------------------------------------------------End--

42+55. Great... *gasp*... even the name of a monk official...
Did you know...? ...i... That's all...
--------------------------------------------------End--

That's enough already... my specialty...
Even my trivia... now... it's no good...
--------------------------------------------------End--

That's... I don't want to ride... a ship...
But... this is the only... transportation...
{NEWPAGE}

Waves and... wind... Chocobo power...
42+56.re... but... compared to a Siparv...
{NEWPAGE}

Before... on a Siparv... *urp*
By the Hypero tribe... I was scolded...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Ugh... talking about... that time's...
It's reviving... Help me...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sky... ship... if I look at one...
Ugh... it's welling up...
{NEWPAGE}

Flying ship... if I rode one... 42+57.I'd likely get sick.
Just by imagining... I feel... 惠
{NEWPAGE}

Ugh... don't make me remember...
Again... it's welling up...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Sorry... I... couldn't sing...
Ship-42+57.i... *urp*
--------------------------------------------------End--

I was on 42+58.watch all night.
Please let me sleep...
--------------------------------------------------End--

It seems I fell asleep.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I've been pulling all-nighters recently.
Please let me sleep...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I sang properly, too, I tell you.
That's enough, isn't it? Let me sleep...
--------------------------------------------------End--

What this person says.
Don't take it seriously.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This person, given any chance,
...makes me give them a lap pillow.
{NEWPAGE}

My leg is really starting to hurt.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This person, too, used to be a proper person, but...
...now they're like this.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Why am I with someone like this...
...I wonder why I'm together with them...
--------------------------------------------------End--

This person had me giving them a lap pillow...
...and was singing like that.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm exasperated with this person, and with myself for forgiving them...
...I'm also exasperated with myself.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If you entrust your {42+59.i} to a Spira Seagull,
...it seems your wish will come true!
--------------------------------------------------End--

Huh! That's a fake seagull!?
Then my {42+59.i}... ugh...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even a fake one, about half of the {42+59.i}...
It'll definitely come true, won't it? Right!!
--------------------------------------------------End--

The people of {Luca}...
...are so carefree, I envy them.
{NEWPAGE}

No matter what major incident occurs,
they're obsessed with Blitz.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I like {blitzball}, but not to that extent.
I can't bring myself to get so absorbed.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Even for the mock gulls,
dreams can't be realized, can they...
{NEWPAGE}

But what is my dream, I wonder.
Even I don't really know.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I was just constantly afraid of '{Sin}',
so there was no such thing as dreaming.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I am researching the animals of Spira.
So, I'm traveling while investigating.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The ones flying around here are...
...Spira mock gulls, it seems.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Mock gulls, compared to real Spira gulls,
seem to be more docile. I can tell by the way they fly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Around the ship, how many birds in total...
I wonder if it's there? I'm interested.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thank you very much.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Will you help with the [42+64.] again?
But just the thought is enough.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Plumage Gulls guide the souls of the dead to {Farplane}
a bird that carries them... There's also such a legend.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The Plumage Gulls are noisy...
I wonder if they're sensing the presence of 『{Sin} 』.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I wish [42+65.] would come soon, so we could devote ourselves to [42+63.] research,
I wish such a world would come to be...
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh, that's it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It's about that much, as I expected.
It's the same as what I counted just now.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Thanks to you, I was able to confirm the number.
It's just a small token of thanks, but please take it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Really~?
Shouldn't it be more?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Really~?
I think that's too much.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hey, I want the exact number...
I want to know, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--

It was a mistake to board Uino
just because the pay was high.
--------------------------------------------------End--

After all, it's 42+66. nights of shi42+60..
I wish for some leniency.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Humans can't work that much, Grandpa also said.
Grandpa said so too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Well, Grandpa...
...was a hard worker, though.
--------------------------------------------------End--

By the captain's orders, the nighttime watch 42+67.42+68. is
double! Double!!
{NEWPAGE}

At this rate, my body won't last.
If you're increasing the shi42+60., then increase the crew too.
--------------------------------------------------End--

There's no use complaining, but...
...there are times when you have no choice but to complain.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I want the flying ship to do its best.
Our livelihood is at stake.
--------------------------------------------------End--

If '{Sin}' disappears from the sea...
Patrol duties will also decrease, I suppose... Surely...
