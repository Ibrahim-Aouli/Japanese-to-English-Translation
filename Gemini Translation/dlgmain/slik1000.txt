Taken by {Sin} at {Zanarkand}.
When I realized, I was in {Spira}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

So, if I could meet {Sin} once more,
I was expecting to return home.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
I will defeat {Sin}.
I will definitely defeat it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

What a foolish thing
I was thinking...
--------------------------------------------------End--

That day, that moment,
Under that burning setting sun...
--------------------------------------------------End--

I realized then.
--------------------------------------------------End--

This is a world I didn't know,
and I couldn't return home so easily.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That this was an inescapable reality.
I finally understood.
--------------------------------------------------End--
