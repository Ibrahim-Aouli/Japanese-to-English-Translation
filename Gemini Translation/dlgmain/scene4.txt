Rikku sometimes comes to Besaid.
--------------------------------------------------End--

She teaches people how to use machines throughout Spira,
And discovers machines buried in the ground or underwater.
--------------------------------------------------End--

She seems to overdo it－－but she always looks happy.

Wakka
Stop it!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Ruck
It's really squishy, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Ruck
Lulu?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka
Oh, she's in the village.
Go meet her.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Ruck
Of course!
--------------------------------------------------End--
Ruck
Yuna－－she seems to be the same as ever.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna
Yes, same as ever.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka
Is Kimahri still on Mt. Gagazet?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Ruck
That's right.
He's teaching the young Ronso many things.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Ruck
He's completely like a teacher now, isn't he?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Ruck
And today,
This I brought from Kimahri－－
--------------------------------------------------End--
Ruck
He said he found it in the mountains.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna
A Sphere?
--------------------------------------------------End--
Wakka
What an unusual shape.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Ruck
Yuna－－look closely.
--------------------------------------------------End--
