{Auron} 
We'll rest here.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
But this is a line of {Al Bhed} people.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
Is there a problem?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
{Al Bhed} doesn't follow the teachings, and...
And look, in {Luca}...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
They kidnapped {Yuna}.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
It's because the guards are sloppy.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Yuna} 
Mr./Ms. {Auron} is {Wakka}'s
concerned about their condition...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
I'm fine!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
I was able to show it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
We're going to the Chocobo stable.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
What lies ahead is daunting.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
It's right after waking up.
It can't be helped.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
But you were there too!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
The one who said, 'Let's defeat that,' was...
You.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Auron} 
If waking up is difficult every time,
Stay awake.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Don't be ridiculous...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
Since you're here,
Everyone, would you like to ride a Chocobo?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
As thanks for defeating the monsters, and for your first time only,
We'll make it 無去 for you.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Rin} 
If you'd like to ride,
Please speak to this person here.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Oh, thank you very much.
That helped me a lot.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Hello there!
This time it's 無去~
--------------------------------------------------End--

This time it's 無去, but...
It seems you're already riding~
{NEWPAGE}

I'll make it 無去 for you next time~
--------------------------------------------------End--

Would you like to ride a Chocobo~?
--------------------------------------------------End--

How to ride a Chocobo...
Would you like to know?
--------------------------------------------------End--

Please take care on your journey.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
Just as expected of the Summoner and the Guard.
You did great in that battle just now.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
For travelers to leave this road,
to have them leave is our 応42+53.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
You all, hmm...
There's a Summoner here too, so I guess it's fine.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
It's a secret, but...
This is a boring 応42+53.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Elma} 
Ah, that monster's 42+54. is...
I took care of it, so rest assured.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Recently, towards {Al Bhed},
the criticism is strong.
{NEWPAGE}

That the operation failed
they say is our fault.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I'm used to being disliked, but
it makes work difficult, which is a problem.
--------------------------------------------------End--

They're all fools; I can't put up with them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

So that {Al Bhed2} does not mislead the people,
we are 42+55.ing them.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Cid} ぞくちょうの めいれいで
I got off the boat with the children.
{NEWPAGE}

The chief is probably prepared
for it to become a severe battle.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I pray for their safety. Anymore, someone
I don't want to see get hurt.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The children are happy.
Everything they see seems new.
--------------------------------------------------End--

I can't take my eyes off the children.
It would be terrible if they fell from the cliff.
--------------------------------------------------End--

That {P0} monk... to the children...
If he does anything, I will absolutely not forgive him.
{NEWPAGE}

I want to believe that's not the case, but...
I can't help but doubt.
--------------------------------------------------End--

When I hear the word "{P0}",
I remember {P0}'s {P1}.
--------------------------------------------------End--

The innocence of children...
It's the same for the people of {P0} and {P1}, isn't it?
--------------------------------------------------End--

As a monastic official, I have denounced
those of {P0} who do not follow the teachings.
{NEWPAGE}

Among {P0}, I was sowing
seeds of meaningless strife.
{NEWPAGE}

I keenly feel my own conduct...
