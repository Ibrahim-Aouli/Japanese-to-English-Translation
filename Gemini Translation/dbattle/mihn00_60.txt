How much you've connected with your summoned beast.
Let me see.

It's the final [40+48?], isn't it?

That's enough. That will do.

{WINDOW}
A summoned beast's parameters are the summoner's...
...improve along with their growth.
Even if it's the same Ifrit,
...depending on the ability of the summoner who [40+49?] summons them,
Their true power differs.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
This Ifrit has high HP and attack power, so...
You will lose if you fight normally.
The summoned beast's commands {Yellow} Guard{White} and {Yellow} Charge{White}...
Let's fight by using them.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
If you choose "Guard," the Overdrive Gauge...
...won't increase, but the damage you take will decrease.
If you choose "Charge," the damage you take will increase, but...
...the gauge will become easier to fill.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
When the enemy seems likely to use a high-damage attack,
"Guard" is effective.
This Ifrit has "Fight" and "Meteor Strike"...
It will repeat sequentially. Next, 'Meteor Strike'...
Since it will unleash it, let's defend with 'Guard'.
