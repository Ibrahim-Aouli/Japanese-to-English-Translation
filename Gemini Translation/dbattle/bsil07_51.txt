{Wakka} 
A slightly troublesome one...
...has appeared.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Heh! That's nothing!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
See? That one should be defeated
with magic.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Monsters that can't be hurt by physical attacks
should be defeated with magic of their weak attribute.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Magic? Attributes?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Well then, shall the Black Mage
show us an example?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Lou! Please!
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
You don't know anything at all, do you...
I'm worried about what lies ahead.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
An attribute is...
...the nature of magic and monsters.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Fire and Ice, Lightning and Water...
There are 4 types in total.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Among these, Fire attribute and Ice attribute...
...are in opposition.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
For Fire attribute monsters,
Ice-attribute magic is effective...
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Conversely, Ice-attribute enemies...
...Fire-attribute magic is their weakness.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Fire and Ice... these two attributes have...
...a [40+50?] and opposing relationship.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Understood?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
There are four types of attributes.
Fire and Ice, Thunder and Water.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
Fire-attribute monsters' weakness is Ice.
Ice-attribute monsters' weakness is Fire.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
You should understand by now, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Tidus} 
Fire and Ice are fine, but...
What about Thunder and Water?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
The relationship between Thunder and Water attributes is also...
...the same as Fire and Ice.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
That one is a Water-attribute monster, so...
Its weakness is... you understand, right?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
If you attack a Water-attribute monster with Thunder-attribute magic...
...it's a one-hit kill.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
That was a good example.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
He's water attribute, so
Fire and ice won't be very effective.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Whoa, whoa, whoa!?
What are you doing healing the enemy!?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Lulu} 
If you choose the wrong attribute,
This kind of thing happens too.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
That's enough, Lou.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
Let's defeat it cleanly.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
What are you {40+51.40+52.} doing?
--------------------------------------------------End--
{Wakka} 
This is frustrating.
It's Thunder for him, isn't it?
