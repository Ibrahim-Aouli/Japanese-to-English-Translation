Belgemine
Show me how strong of a
link you've forged with your aeons.

Belgemine
You have a lot to learn.

Stop. That is enough.

{WINDOW}
An aeon's attributes rise with those
of its summoner.
Thus, the Ifrit one summoner calls may
be very different from one called by
another summoner.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
Because this Ifrit's strength and HP are
both high, it will win in a straight fight.
Try fighting using your aeon's {Yellow}Shield{White} and
{Yellow}Boost{White} commands.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{Yellow}Shield{White} stops your aeon's Overdrive gauge, but
reduces the amount of damage it receives.
{Yellow}Boost{White} accelerates the Overdrive gauge, but
increases the amount of damage received.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
{Yellow}Shield{White} is best when you expect the enemy
to hit your aeon with a powerful attack.
This Ifrit alternates between {Yellow}Attack{White} and
{Yellow}Meteor Strike{White}. A {Yellow}Meteor Strike{White} is coming
up next, so defend your aeon with {Yellow}Shield{White}!
