{White}Watch out for its {OCyan}Bad Breath{White}! It causes {OCyan}poison{White},
{OCyan}darkness{White}, {OCyan}silence{White}, {OCyan}confusion{White}, and {OCyan}slow{White} all at the
same time. It uses {OCyan}Bad Breath{White} after taking a
certain amount of damage, so either try to slow
it down, or wear protective armor.
