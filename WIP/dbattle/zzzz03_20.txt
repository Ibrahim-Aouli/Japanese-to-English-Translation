It swells up each time it takes damage.
After taking damage three times, it will use “Self-Destruct,”
causing heavy damage to the attacker.
You should defeat it within three attacks, but if you can’t,
use “Barfire” to reduce the fire-element damage from “Self-Destruct.”
It is weak to ice, so “Blizzard” is effective.

It has very high HP, so the battle will be long.
Its attack power is high, so use “Blind Attack”

Its Fire attacks are not very powerful, but when attacked,
it counterattacks with a flower [40+48?] that has a “Sleep” effect.
To prevent the “Flower [40+48?],” “Sleep Attack” is effective.

It occasionally uses “[40+49?] Slash,” dealing heavy damage
to all allies, so inflict “Darkness” beforehand using

attack it with magic.

Beware of “Bad Breath,” which simultaneously inflicts
“Poison,” “Darkness,” “Silence,” “Confusion,” and “Slow.”
After receiving a certain amount of [40+50?] damage,
it will use “Bad Breath,” so defeat it before then,
either by accelerating enemy actions [40+51?]
[40+52?], or by equipping armor that prevents status ailments.
