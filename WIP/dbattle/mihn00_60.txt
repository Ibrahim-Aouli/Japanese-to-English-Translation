Belgemine
Show me how deeply
you have bonded with your aeon.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Belgemine
That will be all.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Belgemine
That’s more than enough.

{WINDOW}
An aeon’s parameters increase
as the summoner grows stronger.
Even the same Ifrit will differ in strength
depending on the abilities of the summoner who
[40+49?] summons it.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
This Ifrit has high HP and attack power,
so fighting it head-on will result in defeat.
Use the aeon commands {Yellow}[Defend]{White} and {Yellow}[Boost]{White}
to fight effectively.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
Choosing “Defend” reduces the damage you take,
but your Overdrive gauge will not increase.
Choosing “Boost” increases the damage you take,
but causes the gauge to fill more quickly.
--------------------------------------------------End--
{WINDOW}
When the enemy is about to use a powerful attack,
“Defend” is effective.
This Ifrit alternates between “Attack” and “Meteor Strike.”
It will use “Meteor Strike” next,
so defend with “Defend.”
