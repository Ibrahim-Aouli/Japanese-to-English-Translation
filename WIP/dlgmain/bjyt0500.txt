That child, born between the {Guado}
and humans,
was always alone.
--------------------------------------------------End--

So that even alone
the child could live on,
I wanted to give them strength…
--------------------------------------------------End--

That is why
I became a fayth.
--------------------------------------------------End--

However…
--------------------------------------------------End--

The child gained too much power,
and instead became consumed by it.
--------------------------------------------------End--

Unsatisfied with my power,
the child sought
even greater power…
--------------------------------------------------End--
