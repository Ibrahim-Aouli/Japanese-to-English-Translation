Tasgio
Lady Yuna, it is
a pleasure to meet you.
{NEWPAGE}
Tasgio
I heard your speech
two years ago in the stadium.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Tasgio
But seeing you this close,
you look so much more...
I mean, you are truly beautiful.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna
That's very kind of you to say.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Tasgio
The reason I've come here today is
to talk to you about my grandson.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Tasgio
He's joined the Youth League, you see.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Tasgio
I've nothing against the League, mind you.
It's just me and the missus
belong to New Yevon.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Tasgio
My grandson used to attend all the 
party meetings with his parents, of course.
{NEWPAGE}
Tasgio
That is, until one day...
{NEWPAGE}
Tasgio
I'm sure being around people his
own age can't be bad for the boy.
{NEWPAGE}
Tasgio
Still, I am worried about him.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Tasgio
I feel...oh, how shall I say this...
like our grandchildren are 
moving too quickly.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Font Italic}In the last two years, new groups
have been springing up all over.{Font Normal}
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Font Italic}Everyone wants to be part of a new age.
Everyone wants to build a new age.
Everyone wants to build a new Spira.{Font Normal}
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Font Italic}And they're all racing to find
their own way to do it.{Font Normal}
--------------------------------------------------End--
Tasgio
I only want what's best for him.
But it troubles me when
we agree on so little.
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Font Italic}People have different ideas,
and sometimes, they disagree
on the right thing to do.
{NEWPAGE}


Some people worry about
what the new age will bring.{Font Normal}
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Font Italic}Sometimes, I worry too.{Font Normal}
--------------------------------------------------End--

{Font Italic}I just have to tell myself that for now, 
I'm doing the right thing.{Font Normal}
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna
I understand how you feel.
But Tasgio, maybe you should try
talking to your grandson first.
--------------------------------------------------End--
Yuna
He may walk a different path,
but I'm sure he wants the same
for Spira as we all do.
--------------------------------------------------End--
